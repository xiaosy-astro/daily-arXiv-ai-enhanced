Focusing on binaries with a total mass of $10^6 \\,\nM_{\\odot}$, eccentricities $e=0,0.45,0.9$ and mass ratios $q=1, 0.7$, we find\nthat radiation pressure significantly affects both the spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) and the light curves (LCs). The emission from the\nmini-discs shifts from the optical towards UV frequencies and with a peak\nluminosity orders of magnitude higher, while the circumbinary disc becomes\ncolder and dimmer as a result of its geometrically thinner configuration.\nTemporal variability is affected as well: near UV and soft-X ray fluxes are\nhigher and more variable. Crucially, radiation pressure suppresses the\ncharacteristic \"lump\" formation in equal-mass circular systems, while a lump is\nformed for higher eccentricities without imprinting any modulation on the flux.\nIn the circular case we still find a modulation on the cavity edge timescale at\na frequency $0.36 \\, f_{\\rm K}$, while in eccentric binaries, only robust\norbital period modulations ($f=1,2 \\, f_{\\rm K}$) are observed, with no\nmodulation associated with the cavity orbital motion.

However, in the current era\nof time-critical, multi-wavelength, and multi-messenger astronomy, rapid and\nreliable classification is essential to enable timely follow-up and coordinated\nobservations. In this work, we develop and present two deep learning-based\nclassifiers that integrate convolutional and recurrent neural network\narchitectures. Using multivariate time-series inputs derived from Fermi-GBM\ndata, our models are trained to distinguish among four classes of gamma-ray\ntransients: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs),\nSolar Flares (SFLAREs), and Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs). Furthermore, the\nmodels are designed to flag events that do not conform to any of these\ncategories, providing a pathway for identifying potentially new or rare\ntransient types. Training was conducted using a carefully curated subset of\nhigh-confidence Fermi events. The resulting models achieve an overall\nclassification accuracy of 93%, and identify approximately 2.5% of the triggers\nas outliers of unknown origin. When applied to Fermi events with uncertain\nclassifications, our models assign 60% of them to the TGF category with over\n60% confidence.

Such\nacceleration would modulate the characteristics of the quasi-periodic\noscillations (QPOs) observed in X-ray black hole binaries. In this paper, we\nexplore the influence of spin-aligned acceleration of a black hole on QPOs\nobserved in X-ray binaries. For this purpose, we compute the fundamental\nfrequencies arising from the motion of test particles around an accelerating\n(spin-aligned) black hole and apply the relativistic precession, parametric\nresonance, and forced resonance models to establish their correspondence with\nseveral observed QPOs of X-ray binaries (GRO J1655-40, XTE J1550-564, XTE\nJ1859+226, GRS 1915+105, H1743-322, M82~X-1, and Sgr~A$^{*}$). We then employ\nthe Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method to constrain the black hole\nparameters. Our results show no evidence for spin-aligned acceleration in any\nof the analyzed sources, suggesting that most of these X-ray binaries reside in\nisolated environments and therefore experience only small perturbations to the\nbackground spacetime geometries."}

However, recent observations -\nparticulary the tentative detection of gamma ray burst GRB 221009A up to 18 TeV\nby LHASSO and up to 251 TeV by Carpet-2, challenge the predictions of classical\nEBL absorption models. These exceptionally high-energy photons suggest the\npossibility of new physics affecting photon propagation over cosmological\ndistances. In this context, the gamma-ray spectrum in the tens to hundreds of\nTeV range serves as a valuable probe for potential Lorentz invariance violation\n(LIV) effects or for modifications to photon attenuation due to axion-like\nparticles (ALPs) mixing with photons in cosmic magnetic fields. However, both\nLIV and ALPs explanations, when considered separately, face certain limitations\nin fully accounting for the observed transparency. In this paper, we propose a\nunified framework that combines the effects of ALPs and LIV to explain the\nunexpectedly high survival probability of VHE photons. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the multi-wavelength spectrum of GRB 221009A under this synergistic\nscenario, demonstrating that for photons at 18 TeV and 251 TeV, the combined\ninfluence of ALPs with coupling $g_{a\\gamma} = 13.353 \\times 10^{-11}\\\n\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and mass $m_a = 9.492 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, together\nwith LIV characterized by energy scales $E_1 = 2.4~E_{\\rm Planck}$ for $n = 1$\n, can substantially enhance the photon survival probability.

If the post-merger remnant is a long-lived\nrapid-rotating neutron star, the merger-nova can be significantly enhanced due\nto strong magnetized winds. In this paper, we generate mock BNS merger samples\nusing binary population synthesis model and classify their post-merger\nremnants--black hole (BH) and magnetar, (i.e., long-lived supramassive NS and\nstable NS), based on results from numerical simulations.

The forecasting method relies\nsolely on the instrument response functions (IRFs) to predict ULs for a given\nobservational setup, without the need for full analysis pipelines. The\nrecasting procedure uses published ULs to reinterpret constraints for\nalternative DM models or channels. We demonstrate its utility across a range of\ncanonical annihilation channels, including $b\\bar{b}$, $W^+W^-$,\n$\\tau^+\\tau^-$, and $\\mu^+\\mu^-$, and apply it to several major gamma-ray\nexperiments, including MAGIC, \\textit{Fermi}-LAT, and CTAO. Notably, we develop\na recasting approach that remains effective even when the IRF is unavailable by\nextracting generalized IRF-dependent coefficients from benchmark channels. We\napply this method to reinterpret ULs derived from standard spectra (e.g.,\nPPPC4DMID) in terms of more recent DM scenarios, including a Higgsino-like\nmodel with mixed final states and spectra generated with the CosmiXs model.\nExtensive Monte Carlo simulations and direct comparison with published results\nconfirm the robustness and accuracy of our method, with discrepancies remaining\nwithin statistical uncertainties. The algorithm is generally applicable to any\nscenario where the expected signal model is parametric, offering a powerful\ntool for reinterpreting existing gamma-ray limits and efficiently exploring the\nDM parameter space in current and future indirect detection experiments."}

These events are challenging to identify\nbecause, at extragalactic distances, they can appear similar to other\nastrophysical phenomena. Only a handful have been confidently identified to\ndate, limiting our understanding of their origin and physical properties. This\nstudy focuses on expanding the sample of known events and enabling a more\ndetailed characterization of their observational features and intrinsic\nproperties, while introducing significant improvements in the methods used to\nidentify and analyze them. When applied to archival data from the Gamma-ray\nBurst Monitor (GBM) on the \\Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, this approach\nadded four previously unidentified events the known sample, expanding the total\nto 13 MGFs. This demonstrates both the effectiveness of the method and the\nlikelihood that additional MGFs remain hidden in existing gamma-ray burst\ncatalogs. We utilize this expanded sample to gain a deeper understanding of the\nbroader population of MGFs. We develop a statistical modeling framework that\ncombines previously considered data with modern observations from Fermi/GBM.\nThe model accounts for instrumental sensitivity and the expected diversity in\nevent characteristics.
