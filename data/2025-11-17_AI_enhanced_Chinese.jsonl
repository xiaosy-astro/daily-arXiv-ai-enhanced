Comments encouraged!", "summary": "Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGN) feature order-of-magnitude variability in both the continuum and broad line luminosities on months-to-years long timescales, and are currently unexplained. Simulations have demonstrated that rotating black holes sometimes tear apart tilted accretion disks. These tearing events violently restructure the disk on timescales much shorter than a viscous timescale, hinting at a connection to CLAGN. Here, we show that disk tearing can power changing-look events. We report synthetic observations of an extremely high resolution three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a geometrically thin, tilted accretion disk around a rapidly rotating, $10^8\\,M_\\odot$ black hole. We perform ray-tracing calculations that follow the disk light to both a line of sight camera and to a distribution of cameras in a prescribed torus-like broad line region. The continuum photoionizes the broad line region and we calculate the resulting spectrum. Both the continuum and line luminosities undergo order of magnitude swings on months-to-years long timescales. We find shorter, weeks long variability driven by the geometric precession of the inner disk and an intraday quasi-periodic oscillation driven by radial breathing of the inner disk. When the torn disk precesses, it causes asymmetric illumination of the broad line region, driving time-evolving red-to-blue asymmetries of the broad emission lines that may be a smoking gun for disk tearing. We also make predictions for future photometric observations from ULTRASAT and Vera Rubin Observatory, both of which may play an important role in detecting future changing-look events.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These objects emit radio pulses similar to those of pulsars, but at much longer periods -- on the order of minutes to hours. With duty cycles of only a few percent, individual pulses have been observed to last between 10 and 1000 seconds. This places LPTs in a timescale gap between the two main techniques used in transient radio searches: time-series analysis at millisecond to second timescales, and image-plane searches sensitive to variability on the scale of days. As a result, LPTs remained undetected until recently, and only a handful are currently known. To increase the sample of known LPTs, we conducted a dedicated search using 200 hours of archival data from the ASKAP Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey, covering 750 deg$^2$ of sky at the shortest possible imaging time step of 10-seconds. This represents the first large-scale search using ASKAP data at second-scale resolution. Although no LPTs were detected, we identified flares from six stars, at least one had never been detected in the radio regime before. We placed a lower limit on the transient surface density of $2.21\\times10^{-6}$ deg$^{-2}$ at a 10-second timescale, with a sensitivity of 16.9 mJy. Our findings evaluate the feasibility of detecting radio transients using 10-second imaging with ASKAP and provide insights into improving detection pipelines and observation strategies for LPTs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9ASKAP\u5de1\u5929\u6570\u636e\u768410\u79d2\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u641c\u7d22\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u957f\u5468\u671f\u5c04\u7535\u6682\u73b0\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc6\u522b\u4e866\u9897\u6052\u661f\u7684\u5c04\u7535\u8000\u53d1\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u6682\u73b0\u6e90\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0b\u9650\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u5468\u671f\u5c04\u7535\u6682\u73b0\u6e90(LPTs)\u662f\u8fd1\u671f\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5176\u5468\u671f\u5728\u5206\u949f\u5230\u5c0f\u65f6\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5c04\u7535\u6682\u73b0\u6e90\u641c\u7d22\u6280\u672f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7a7a\u767d\u3002\u4e3a\u589e\u52a0\u5df2\u77e5LPTs\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ASKAP\u5de1\u5929\u9879\u76ee\u7684200\u5c0f\u65f6\u5b58\u6863\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728750\u5e73\u65b9\u5ea6\u5929\u533a\u8fdb\u884c10\u79d2\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u6210\u50cf\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u79d2\u7ea7\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21ASKAP\u6570\u636e\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230LPTs\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc6\u522b\u4e866\u9897\u6052\u661f\u7684\u5c04\u7535\u8000\u53d1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u9897\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u5c04\u7535\u6ce2\u6bb5\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u3002\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e8610\u79d2\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6682\u73b0\u6e90\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0b\u9650\uff1a2.21\u00d710^-6 deg^-2\uff0c\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4e3a16.9 mJy\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528ASKAP\u8fdb\u884c10\u79d2\u6210\u50cf\u63a2\u6d4b\u5c04\u7535\u6682\u73b0\u6e90\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdbLPTs\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, direct and precise measurements of the disk density profiles remain elusive for current telescopes. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to pinpoint the gas density if an inspiralling stellar mass binary black hole is embedded in the AGN disk. Furthermore, if the barycenter of the pair follows an eccentric orbit around an AGN, then space-borne gravitational wave detectors can measure the density of the surrounding disk with multi-year observations by tracking the gravitational wave evolution. The error between the inferred density profile and the injected truth can be constrained to below $2\\times10^{-11}\\rm g/cm^3$.

Two major gamma-ray flares have been observed during the Fermi era: one in January 2011 and other in June 2019. During these events, CGRaBS J0211+1051 was also bright in other energy bands. On the other hand, there are also examples of optical activity that do not exhibit any comparable gamma-ray variability. Here, we study the temporal and spectral characteristics of the object in an attempt to understand the emission mechanisms operating in this source. A peculiar feature in its spectrum is the X-ray domain, which is unusually soft considering its object class. Interestingly, the relatively soft UV and optical spectrum does not extrapolate well to the X-rays. To mimic the observed SEDs during quiescent and flaring periods, we use both a purely leptonic and a hadro-leptonic modeling approach to reproduce four broadband SEDs from various epochs. When taking into account the steep optical-UV spectrum, we find that the hadro-leptonic scenarios better explains the SEDs compared to the purely leptonic model. The hadro-leptonic interpretation of the two gamma-ray flares suggests that CGRaBS J0211+1051 could be both a potential neutrino emitter and TeV-bright (E>10 TeV). Thus, it may offer a unique test bed to check for hadro-leptonic contributions to the multi-messenger emission in blazar jets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u4f4e\u540c\u6b65\u5cf0BL Lac\u5929\u4f53CGRaBS J0211+1051\u7684\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u6b21\u4e3b\u8981\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u8000\u6591\uff0cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u8c31\u5f02\u5e38\u8f6f\uff0c\u5f3a\u5b50-\u8f7b\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u7eaf\u8f7b\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6e90\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u548cTeV\u4eae\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76CGRaBS J0211+1051\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5f02\u5e38\u8f6f\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u8c31\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e0e\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u8d85\u8fc7\u5341\u5e74\u7684\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7eaf\u8f7b\u5b50\u548c\u5f3a\u5b50-\u8f7b\u5b50\u4e24\u79cd\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u5bbd\u5e26SED\u8fdb\u884c\u62df\u5408\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u5b50-\u8f7b\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684SED\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9661\u5ced\u7684\u5149\u5b66-\u7d2b\u5916\u8c31\uff1b\u8be5\u6e90\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u548cTeV\u4eae\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "CGRaBS J0211+1051\u4e3a\u68c0\u9a8c\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\u55b7\u6d41\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5b50-\u8f7b\u5b50\u5bf9\u591a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

The mission ended after 36 h due to a balloon leak that resulted in the payload being lost in the Pacific Ocean. Over the course of the mission, the onboard Cherenkov Telescope (CT) was pointed just below the Earth's limb to search for optical signals from upward-moving extensive air showers that were induced by decaying tau-leptons that were generated by the conversion of $>10$ PeV tau-neutrinos in Earth. Such very-high energy (VHE) neutrinos may be produced in several classes of astrophysical sources that are suspected of possibly accelerating particles to ultra-high energies. In this contribution, we discuss the EUSO-SPB2 Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) campaign to search for VHE neutrino signals coming from astrophysical sources that crossed the CT's field of view ($6.4^\\circ \\times 12.8^\\circ$). We also present a new software tool designed for scheduling observations, the Neutrino Target Scheduler, that we developed to support the ToO campaign.

These include the broad-band noise (BBN) components and various types of narrow components called quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). There is currently no consensus about either what determines the presence/absence of the BBN or what generates the QPOs. Many believe the latter is due to frame-dragging effects caused by Lense-Thirring torques. We wish to investigate the potential impact of those frame-dragging effects on the accretion disk itself. In particular, we focus on its impact on the observed variability and the presence (and types) of QPOs associated. We make analytical estimates to assess the potential presence of a geometric warp in the inner accretion disk during state transitions. We show that the presence of a warp can modify the spectral-timing properties in a way that matches the observed transition between QPO types during outbursts. We also discuss the peculiar case of Cyg X-1, as well as how the hard-to-soft transition could be driven by the warp itself. The (expected) emergence of a warp provides a consistent explanation for the evolution of both the BBN and the QPO properties during state transitions.

We have undertaken a campaign with the Green Bank Telescope targeting specific orbital phases designed to improve our constraint on the pulsar's mass through the detection of a relativistic Shapiro delay. Both frequentist and Bayesian techniques -- the latter incorporating priors from white dwarf binary evolution models -- are applied to fifteen years of radio observations, yielding relatively weak constraints on the companion and pulsar masses of $0.23^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and $1.87^{+1.11}_{-0.67}$ M$_{\\odot}$, respectively (68.3% CI from Bayesian fits); however, the orbital inclination is measured to better relative precision ($79.80^{+3.47}_{-4.70}$ degrees). Restricting the maximum allowed pulsar mass to 3 M$_{\\odot}$ while simultaneously sampling the noise and timing models improves the constraint and lowers the measured mass to $1.62^{+0.73}_{-0.58}$ M$_{\\odot}$. While our radio-derived inclination result has informed recent NICER X-ray studies of PSR J1231$-$1411, the lessons learned from this troublesome pulsar will also bolster future high-precision mass measurement campaigns and resulting constraints on the neutron star interior equation of state.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9PSR J1231-1411\u8109\u51b2\u661f15\u5e74\u7684\u5c04\u7535\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u590f\u76ae\u7f57\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6d4b\u91cf\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u503e\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "PSR J1231-1411\u662fNICER\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u79d1\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u79ef\u7d2f\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u548c\u5c04\u7535\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ea6\u675f\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Nan\u00e7ay\u548cGreen Bank\u5c04\u7535\u671b\u8fdc\u955c15\u5e74\u7684\u8ba1\u65f6\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u9891\u7387\u4e3b\u4e49\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u540e\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u767d\u77ee\u53cc\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u590f\u76ae\u7f57\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u5f97\u4f34\u661f\u8d28\u91cf0.23^{+0.09}_{-0.06} M\u2299\uff0c\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8d28\u91cf1.87^{+1.11}_{-0.67} M\u2299\uff0c\u8f68\u9053\u503e\u89d279.80^{+3.47}_{-4.70}\u5ea6\u3002\u9650\u5236\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u6700\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u4e3a3 M\u2299\u65f6\uff0c\u6d4b\u5f97\u8d28\u91cf\u4e3a1.62^{+0.73}_{-0.58} M\u2299\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u8d28\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u4f46\u8f68\u9053\u503e\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5c06\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u6d3b\u52a8\u548c\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Machine-readable versions of the maps and spectra are available on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/17570420", "summary": "Microquasars have emerged as promising candidates to explain the cosmic-ray flux at petaelectronvolt energies. LHAASO observations revealed V4641~Sgr as the most extreme example so far. Using $\\approx$100~h of H.E.S.S. data, we performed a spectro-morphological study of the gamma-ray emission around V4641~Sgr. We employed HI and dedicated CO observations of the region to infer the target material for cosmic-ray interactions. We detected multi-TeV emission around V4641~Sgr with a high significance. The emission region is elongated. We found a power-law spectrum with an index $\\approx$1.8, and together with results from other gamma-ray instruments, this reveals a spectral energy distribution that peaks at energies of $\\approx$100~TeV for the first time. We found indications (3$\u03c3$) of a two-component morphology, with indistinguishable spectral properties. The position of V4641~Sgr is inconsistent with the best-fit position of the single-component model and with the dip between the two components. We found no significant evidence of an energy-dependent morphology. No dense gas was found at any distance towards V4641~Sgr. The peak of the SED at $\\approx$100~TeV identifies V4641~Sgr as a candidate cosmic-ray accelerator beyond the so-called knee. The absence of dense target gas places stringent energetic constraints on hadronic interpretations, however. The H.E.S.S. measurement requires an unusually hard ($\\approx 1.5$) spectral index for the protons. A leptonic scenario faces fewer obstacles if the particle transport is fast enough to avoid losses and to reproduce the observed energy-independent morphology. The absence of bright \\xray emission across the gamma-ray emission region requires a magnetic field strength $\\lesssim3$~$\u03bc$G, however. Our findings favour a leptonic origin of the gamma-ray emission.

Interactions of UHECRs with radiation fields and interstellar matter generate very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays and neutrinos, making them key components in the multimessenger framework. This study examines the cosmogenic gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes resulting from UHECR propagation in starburst galaxies with supernova remnants, with a particular focus on NGC 1068, a well-established high-energy neutrino source. Using extragalactic simulations, we calculate the upper limit on cosmic-ray luminosity, applying upper limits on gamma-ray fluxes derived from observations by H.E.S.S. and MAGIC observatories. Our analysis incorporates the effects of both extragalactic and galactic magnetic fields on particle propagation, constraining the maximum extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF) intensity to $10^{-14}~\\mathrm{G}$ to ensure that at least 90\\% of injected UHECRs successfully reach Earth. The results provide upper limits on gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes, estimates of UHECR luminosity for individual sources, and predictions for the detection capabilities of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory regarding gamma-ray emission from NGC 1068.
