We account not only for vortices in the neutron superfluid inside these stars, but also for the flux tubes in the proton-superconductor subsystem, using a coupled model with the neutron superfluid, proton superconductor, the Maxwell equations for the vector potential ${\\bf A}$, and the Poisson equation for self-gravity."}

Despite the disclosure of a nearby pulsar and multiple studies in the high-energy (HE, E > 100 MeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) regimes, there have been no confirmed counterparts (e.g., an SNR shell or other extended structure) in X-ray or other wavelengths. We present the result of our study of the VHE emission of HESS~J1857+026 with VERITAS as part of a multi-wavelength investigation to uncover its emission mechanisms. Our result confirms the extended nature of the source and we characterize its spectral and morphological features in the VHE band. Using the morphology of the source revealed in our analysis, we also explore the underlying transport process of a possible electron population in a leptonic PWN scenario for the gamma-ray emission."}

Central Compact Objects (CCOs), identified in X-rays at the centers of other remnants, challenged this view, as decades of searches yielded no radio detections. Here we show that the prototypical young CCO 1E 1207.4-5209 is in fact a faint radio pulsar rotating at the 0.4s X-ray period. Analysis of its polarization indicates that the radio beam intersects our line of sight near the magnetic pole, affirming its radio faintness' being intrinsic. Once its supernova remnant dissipates, this source would be misidentified as an apparently gigayear-old pulsar. The CCO's low radio flux density may explain why many supernova remnants lack detectable radio pulsars and suggests a hidden population of young, slowly rotating neutron stars."}

White paper submitted to the ESO Expanding Horizons Call on behalf of ET OSB Div3", "summary": "Ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories have transformed our view of compact-object mergers, yet their reach still limits a comprehensive reconstruction of the processes that generate these systems. Only next-generation observatories, with order-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity and access to lower frequencies, will be capable of radically extending this detection horizon. GW observations will make it possible to detect the complete population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts of $z \\simeq 100$. This capability will deliver an unprecedented map of merger events across cosmic time and enable precise reconstruction of their mass and spin distributions, while for several thousand events the signal-to-noise ratio will surpass 100, enabling precision physics of BHs and neutron stars (NSs). The access to lower frequencies will also open the intermediate-mass window, detecting systems of order $\\sim 10^3 M_\\odot$, potentially in coordination with multi-band observations from LISA. At higher redshifts, where Population III stars have so far remained beyond reach - even for the James Webb Space Telescope - GW observations by next-generation detectors will routinely provide observations of BH mergers thought to originate from these primordial stellar populations. Such measurements are expected to play a central role in clarifying the early assembly of supermassive black holes. A single detection of a binary BH system at $z \\gtrsim 30$, or of a compact object with sub-solar mass and no tidal deformability, would constitute strong evidence for the existence of primordial black holes. Such a discovery would have profound consequences for our understanding of dark matter and the early Universe. Ultimately, the GW observations will become revolutionary for identifying the physical channels responsible for compact binary formation."}

Naturally, such instrumental improvements open up possibilities for new and interesting scientific studies. We aim to show that the study of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) in particular is bound to profit from these high-resolution measurements. This is because PWNe are the dominant Galactic source population at TeV energies, exhibit hard spectra up to hundreds of TeV and from X-ray observations are known to possess plentiful structure on arcminute scales. Using HESS J1813-178 and MSH 15-52 as examples, we create simple leptonic models of the TeV morphology of these sources based on X-ray observations and existing gamma-ray measurements. Then, assuming different models for the exposure and point spread function of the observatory, we create mock observations with the future CTAO southern array. We use these to assess the ability of these observations to differentiate between models and study the physics of these sources, in particular to infer the structure of the magnetic field and electron distributions. We find that future observations with the CTAO southern array at multi-TeV energies - in combination with existing X-ray measurements - will likely be able to constrain the distributions of magnetic field and high-energy electrons in these sources. We demonstrate that the sensitivity of these measurements can be significantly enhanced with the improved angular resolution achievable with novel reconstruction algorithms. However, we also show that in the relevant multi-TeV regime, signal-photon statistics remain a limitation and trading event statistics for improved angular resolution is not necessarily advantageous."}

For Type Ia SN 2006X, we derive a 3$σ$ upper limit of 0.7 mJy at 0.146 GHz, and using radio emission models based on the CS15DD2 explosion model, we constrain the circumstellar density to $n_{\\rm H} \\lesssim 10$ cm$^{-3}$ for the microphysical parameters $ε_{\\rm rel} = ε_{\\rm B} = 0.01$.

These observations span three epochs: 2002 and 2006 with XMM-Newton alone, covering the $0.3-10$ keV energy range, and a coordinated XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observation in 2016, covering the $0.3-60$ keV energy range. The X-ray spectra across all epochs exhibit both neutral and ionized absorption, along with reflection features from the accretion disc, including a prominent Compton hump in the broadband data. Notably, the spectral shape varies across epochs. Our analysis suggests this variability is attributed to changes in both line-of-sight absorption and the intrinsic emission from PG 1535+547. The source is obscured by multiple layers of partially and/or fully covering neutral and ionized absorbers, with neutral column densities ranging from undetectable levels in the least obscured phase to $\\sim0.3-5\\times10^{23}\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ in the most obscured phase. A clear warm absorber is revealed during the least obscured phase. The continuum remains fairly consistent ($Γ\\approx 2.2\\pm0.1$) during the first two observations, followed by a substantial flux decrease (by a factor of $\\sim7$ in the $2-10$ keV band) in 2016 compared to 2006. The 2016 data indicates the source is in a reflection-dominated state during this epoch, with a reflection fraction of $R>7$ and an X-ray source located at a height $\\leq 1.72r_g$. Simultaneous fitting of the multi-epoch data suggests a rapidly rotating black hole with a spin parameter, $a>0.99$. These findings imply that strong light-bending effects may account for the observed continuum flux reduction."}

A relevant background to the astrophysical flux is prompt atmospheric neutrinos, originating from the decay of charmed mesons produced in cosmic-ray-induced air showers. The production rate of charmed mesons in the very forward phase space of hadronic interactions, and consequently, the prompt neutrino flux, remains uncertain and has not yet been observed by neutrino detectors. An accurate measurement of this flux would enhance our understanding of fundamental particle physics such as hadronic interactions in high-energy cosmic-ray-induced air showers and the nucleon structure. Furthermore, an experimental characterization of this background flux will improve the precision of astrophysical neutrino flux spectral measurements. In this work, we perform a combined fit of cascade-like and track-like neutrino events in IceCube to constrain the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux. Given that the prompt flux is a sub-dominant contribution, treating systematic uncertainties arising from the potential mis-modeling of the conventional and astrophysical neutrino fluxes is critical for its measurement. Our analysis yields a non-zero best-fit result, which is, however, consistent with the null hypothesis of no prompt flux within one standard deviation. Consequently, we establish an upper bound on the flux at $4\\times 10^{-16}$ (GeV m$^2$ s sr)$^{-1}$ at 10 TeV."}

A more realistic description might be that of a force-free magnetic field. Here, we suggest that, in the absence of outflows, neither of those reflect the actual behavior when the magnetic field spreads diffusively into a more poorly conducting turbulent exterior outside dynamo. In particular, we show that the usual ordering of the dipole magnetic field being the most slowly decaying one is altered, and that the quadrupole can develop a toroidal component that decays even more slowly with radial distance. This behavior is best seen for spherical dynamo volumes and becomes more complicated for oblate ones. In either case, however, those fields are confined within a magnetosphere beyond which the field drops exponentially. The magnetosphere expands ballistically (i.e., linearly in time $t$) during the exponential growth phase of the dynamo, but diffusively proportional to $t^{1/2}$ during the saturated phase. We demonstrate that the Faraday displacement current, which plays a role in a vacuum, can safely be neglected in all cases. For quadrupolar configurations, the synchrotron emission from the magnetosphere is found to be constant along concentric rings. The total and the polarized radio emissions from the dipolar or the quadrupolar configurations display large scale radial trends that are potentially distinguishable with existing radio telescopes. The superposition of magnetic fields from galaxies in the outskirts of the voids between galaxy clusters can therefore not explain the void magnetization of the intergalactic medium, reinforcing the conventional expectation that those fields are of primordial origin."}
