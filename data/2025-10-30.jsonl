Cosmic ray (CR) electrons\nare likely accelerated (or re-accelerated) at merger and accretion shocks via\ndiffusive shock acceleration (DSA). However, in the presence of the large\ndiffusion coefficients one would naively expect in the rarefied, relatively\nunmagnetized ICM, this acceleration--in particular, the maximum proton energy\n($E_{\\rm max}$)--is limited by long acceleration times. On the other hand,\nrecent work on CR transport suggests that the diffusion coefficient can be\nsuppressed in ICM-like environments. In this picture, deviations from local\nthermodynamic equilibrium can trigger the mirror instability, creating\nplasma-scale magnetic structures, or \"micromirrors,\" that efficiently scatter\nCRs. In this paper, we investigate the implications of micromirror confinement\nfor shock acceleration in the ICM. We demonstrate that micromirrors enforce a\nminimum value of $E_{\\rm max} \\gtrsim 100$ GeV that does not rely on CR-driven\nmagnetic field amplification. We also discuss micromirror confinement in the\ncontext of cosmological simulations and $\\gamma$-ray observations, and present\na simulation of a Coma-like merging cluster that self-consistently includes CR\nacceleration at shocks, with an effective diffusion coefficient set by\nmicromirrors. We show that the introduction of micromirrors yields simulated\ngalaxy clusters that remain consistent with $\\gamma$-ray observations."}

In TDEs it is expected that the\norbital angular momentum of the disrupted star is generally misaligned with the\nSMBH spin axis, which should result in a misaligned super-Eddington disk\nprecessing around the SMBH spin axis due to the Lense-Thirring effect.

We demonstrate that the precession of the\ndisk and wind drive time-dependent obscuration and reprocessing of X-ray\nradiation. Depending on the orientation of the viewing angle of the observer\nand the tilt angle of the disk, four main types of variability are induced: 1)\nThe smooth-TDEs: The emissions from these TDEs show no fluctuations; 2) The\ndimmer: The main emission type (X-ray or optical) stays the same, with small to\nmoderate modulations of brightness; 3) The blinker: X-ray and optical emissions\ntake turns to dominate in one cycle of precession, with dramatic changes in the\nX-ray fluxes. 4) The siren: X-ray and optical emissions take over each other\ntwice per cycle, possibly with two different peak X-ray fluxes within one\ncycle. In all three scenarios, we observe an inverse correlation between X-ray\nand optical emissions.

In this work, we discover\na peculiar type of burst whose light curve has a plateau-like feature among the\nlong bursts of the magnetar SGR J1935+2154. Based on these bursts, we\nidentified four burst candidates with eclipse-like characteristics. By fitting\ntheir light curves with the eclipse fireball model, the viewing angle of the\nmagnetar relative to its spin axis is estimated to be $17^\\circ \\pm 10^\\circ$.\nThe distances from the fireballs to the magnetar are found to be more than five\ntimes the magnetar's radius, indicating that the fireballs are suspended in the\nmagnetosphere rather than adhering to the magnetar surface. We also find this\nconfiguration is well consistent with the implication of the cyclotron\nresonance scattering feature in their spectra. Our results suggest that some\nintermediate X-ray bursts of SGR 1935+2154 may originate from magnetic\nreconnection within the magnetosphere rather than the starquake."}

This filament,\ncharacterized by the highest particle acceleration rate among Cas A's outer\nshells, offers an exceptional opportunity to investigate underlying\nastrophysical mechanisms. Since 2000, the non-thermal flux has increased by\nseveral tens of percent before plateauing, while the spectral shape has\nremained largely unchanged. Over the past two decades, the filament's\nmorphology has evolved significantly, splitting into two distinct sections.\nDetailed analysis reveals contrasting behaviors: one section shows a flux\nincrease followed by saturation, while the other maintains a steady flux. These\ndifferences likely arise from nonlinear effects, including magnetohydrodynamic\ninteractions influenced by magnetic field orientation, interactions with\nsurrounding material, and complex fluid dynamics associated with young\nsupernova remnants. The localized evolution of this filament, captured with\nhigh spatial resolution, provides critical insights into the temporal dynamics\nof non-thermal particles and the generation of cosmic rays from asymmetric\nsupernova explosions."}

Their thermal and luminosity evolution\nreflects key internal properties such as the equation of state (EoS), nucleon\nsuperfluidity and superconductivity, envelope composition, and magnetic field,\nand so on. Recent observations [\\textit{e.g.}, V.

The\nfailure of the standard cooling models implies the presence of additional\ninternal heating mechanism. Building on the previous study [M. Fujiwara\n\\textit{et al}., JCAP \\textbf{03}, 051 (2024)], which proposed vortex creep\nheating (VCH) from the frictional motion of superfluid vortices as a viable\nmechanism, we extend the cooling framework to include both VCH and direct Urca\n(DUrca) processes. These are implemented in our code to explore their combined\nimpact, particularly for massive neutron stars where DUrca operates. By varying\nrotational parameters ($P$, $\\dot{P}$, $P_0$), EoS models (APR, BSk24), pairing\ngaps, and envelope compositions, we examine how heating-cooling interplay\nshapes the temperature evolution. Our results show that VCH can substantially\nmitigate the rapid cooling driven by DUrca, offering new evolutionary pathways\nfor massive neutron stars."}

We also detected a clear difference in velocity dispersion\nbetween the approaching and receding (redshifted) jet components in the 5.5-9\nkeV band outside eclipse. The receding jet exhibited a smaller velocity\ndispersion ($1400 \\pm 200$ km s$^{-1}$) than the approaching jet. Since the\nobservation was conducted when the approaching jet was tilted toward the\nobserver, this may suggest that the receding jet was more extensively occulted\nby the accretion disk."}

We explore two primary scenarios for the\ndistribution of UHECR sources, assuming that their production rate follows\neither the cosmic star-formation-rate or stellar-mass density. By jointly\nfitting the UHECR energy spectrum and mass composition measured by the Pierre\nAuger Observatory above the ankle (10^{18.7} eV), we derive constraints on the\nacceleration mechanisms, source energetics, and elemental abundances at escape.\nUsing these constraints, we generate sky maps above 40 EeV based on a catalog\nof over 400,000 galaxies out to 350 Mpc, providing a near-infrared flux-limited\nsample that maps the two stellar-activity tracers across the full sky.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Late-time light curve plateaus in tidal disruption events (TDEs) are often\napproximated as flat and time-independent. This simplification is motivated by\ntheoretical modeling of spreading late time TDE disks, which often predicts\nslow light curve evolution. However, if time evolution can be detected,\nlate-time light curves will yield more information than has been previously\naccessible. In this work, we re-examine late-time TDE data to test how well the\nflat plateau assumption holds. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate the\nmaximum likelihood for a family of theory-agnostic models and apply the Akaike\ninformation criterion to find that that roughly one third of our sample favors\nevolving plateaus, one third favors truly flat plateaus, and one third shows no\nstatistically significant evidence for any plateau. Next, we refit the TDEs\nthat exhibit statistically significant plateaus using a magnetically elevated\n$\\alpha$-disk model, motivated by the lack of clear thermal instability in late\ntime TDE light curves. From these model-dependent fits, we obtain estimates for\nthe supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, the mass of the disrupted star, and\nthe $\\alpha$ parameter itself. Fitted $\\alpha$ values range from $10^{-3}$ to\n0.4 (the mean fitted $\\alpha=10^{-1.8}$, with scatter of 0.6 dex), broadly\nconsistent with results from magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Finally, we\nestimate the timescales of disk precession in magnetically elevated TDE models.\nTheoretically, we find that disk precession times may be orders of magnitude\nshorter than in unmagnetized Shakura-Sunyaev disks, and grow in time as $T_{\\rm\nprec}\\propto t^{35/36}$; empirically, by using fitted $\\alpha$ parameters, we\nestimate that late time disks may experience $\\sim$few-10 precession cycles."}
