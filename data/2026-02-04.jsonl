We study rotating BHs surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM), exploring their observable features through both analytical and numerical approaches. Using the existence criterion of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), we first derive joint constraints on the PFDM intensity parameter~k and the spin parameter~a. Within the resulting physically allowed parameter regime, we perform high-resolution, general-relativistic ray-tracing simulations of thin accretion disks at 87~GHz and 230~GHz, capturing the detailed brightness morphology and photon ring structure shaped by PFDM. By incorporating angular diameter measurements of M87^{*} and Sgr~A^{*} from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), we further narrow down the viable parameter space and directly compare synthetic images with EHT observations of M87^{*}. We find that the inclusion of PFDM improves the agreement with the observed compact shadow and asymmetric brightness distribution, suggesting that dark matter may leave observable imprints on horizon-scale images. Our results position PFDM as a physically motivated extension to the Kerr geometry and highlight a promising astrophysical pathway for probing dark matter near BHs with current and future VLBI campaigns."}

Such interpretations generally assume that the observed modulation frequency directly corresponds to an intrinsic oscillation frequency of the source. We show that this assumption is not generally valid and that interpreting such features without accounting for relativistic propagation may lead to misleading inferences about the engine nature. We show that relativistic propagation effects - most importantly integration over equal-arrival-time surfaces - act as a frequency-dependent filter that can significantly modify or suppress intrinsic variability. In the constant- $Γ$ case, the angular kernel acts as a stationary low-pass filter that suppresses high-frequency variability without altering its frequency, whereas Blandford-McKee deceleration renders the filter time-dependent and manifests observationally as an apparent frequency drift."}

This release benefits from improved event reconstruction and nearly three additional years of observations. It also incorporates a systematic multi-source fitting framework, enabling more flexible and accurate modeling of the gamma-ray sky. This fitting procedure was modeled after the manual approach used in HAWC analyses of individual sources and regions, as well as other gamma-ray catalogs, like the 4FGL. In addition to more varied modeling of source morphology and spectral parameters compared to previous HAWC catalogs, this catalog uses a robust modeling of Galactic diffuse TeV emission. The fitting procedure uses both point-like and symmetric Gaussian spatial templates to model the source morphology. The spectral shape of the emission is modeled with either a simple power-law or log-parabola to explore curvature in the spectral energy distribution. We report 85 sources at the 4σ level, including 11 sources not associated with any TeVCat source using a distance-based association criterion. Distance-based association with the 1LHAASO catalog results in 22 4HWC sources without a counterpart. Additionally, there are 12 sources not associated with any physical counterpart in the Low- or High-Mass X-Ray Binary, the ATNF, or Fermi Pulsar, or SNR catalogs of sources. Five of the aforementioned sources have no counterpart in any of the catalogs searched and represent an opportunity for follow-up observations."}

While the post-plateau normal decay index ($α_2$) is commonly used to constrain the afterglow dynamics, the shallow-decay slope of the plateau itself ($α_1$) has received comparatively little attention. Recent observations, however, reveal substantial dispersion in $α_1$, raising the question of whether GRBs with rising, flat and mildly decaying plateaus represent intrinsically distinct populations. To address this question, we collect a uniform sample of 185 $\\textit{Swift}$ GRBs with a well-defined plateau and divide them into three groups based on $α_1$. Using a non-parametric approach, we reconstruct their X-ray luminosity functions, redshift distributions and event rates. It is found that the three groups exhibit statistically consistent properties across all diagnostics, with no evidence for group-specific features. Monte Carlo perturbation tests further show that these results are insensitive to the adopted classification boundaries of $α_1$. Our results indicate that variations in the plateau slope $α_1$ do not define distinct GRB subclasses, but instead the sample constitutes a statistically uniform population governed by a common framework."}

Rev. E", "summary": "This paper explores the catastrophic energy transformations, in particular the ones leading to the generation of a flow in a weakly rotating self-gravitating fluid/gas found, for instance, in the vicinity of a massive compact object. Because of the similarity in the governing equations, the system dynamics is worked out exactly in parallel to the methods developed for investigating catastrophic relaxation in stellar plasmas [1-3]. In the latter a more ``complex\" equilibrium state, on slow changes in the environment, can lose its equilibrium (catastrophe), and transform to a less complex state with a very different energy mix from the original. It is shown that a similar transformation in the weakly rotating self-gravitating fluid/gas will convert much of its gravitation energy into kinetic energy in the flow. Since flows are a perennial ingredient of high-energy astrophysical systems, the energy transformation processes revealed in present study, can advance our understanding of a variety of them. Some particularly relevant examples are: macro-scale flows / structures in galaxies, accretion discs, and the dynamics and stability of a rotating star / its atmosphere."}

To explain this hierarchy of timescales, we consider a scenario in which a stellar object undergoes repeated partial tidal disruptions by a black hole (BH). We find that if a white dwarf (WD) is on a highly eccentric orbit ($e\\approx0.97$) around an intermediate-mass black hole (BH) with $M_{\\rm BH}\\lesssim10^{6}\\,M_\\odot$ and $a = 50\\,R_\\odot\\left(M_{\\rm BH}/10^{6}\\,M_\\odot\\right)^{1/3}$, the observed properties of GRB 250702B can be naturally reproduced. In this framework, the duration of each flare is determined by the viscous accretion timescale of material stripped near pericenter, with a typical mass $ΔM \\approx 2\\times10^{-2}\\,M_\\odot$. The minimum recurrence time corresponds to the orbital period, while the total activity period is set by the secular orbital evolution timescale leading to the complete disruption of the WD. Furthermore, if $M_{\\rm BH}\\gtrsim10^{5}\\,M_\\odot$ and the orbit has a minimum polar angle relative to the BH equatorial plane of $θ_{\\rm min}\\gtrsim0.12 {\\rm rad}$, relativistic frame dragging induces $\\gtrsim0.1$ rad precession of the orbital angular momentum between successive pericenter passages, comparable to a typical GRB jet half-opening angle, resulting in intermittent alignment with the observer and irregular flare spacing. The WD experiences $\\approx40$ jet-launch episodes before complete disruption, but only four are expected to be observed on-axis. The remaining off-axis jets become visible at late times, enhancing the radio afterglow by about an order of magnitude, providing a testable prediction of this scenario."}

In this work, we investigate the generation and subsequent evolution of magnetic fields triggered by anisotropic radiation fields in black hole accretion discs with compact rotating inner corona. We self-consistently evolve the magnetic field using the generalized field evolution MHD equation, including advection, shear-driven induction, and Hall effects. The radiation field acts as a primary field generator, while azimuthal rotation in the magnetized plasma provides rapid amplification. We find that radiation-generated fields efficiently reach a dominant toroidal component by Keplerian rotation, leading to magnetic field strengths of order $\\sim 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{G}$ in the vicinity of a 10 solar mass black hole and accretion disc-corona emitting at luminosity equivalent to the Eddington unit. These magnetic fields are achieved within viscous timescales and reach or exceed local equipartition estimates based on gas pressure. When vertical outflows are included, the amplified magnetic fields are advected into the corona, magnetizing disc-launched winds and jet precursors with field strengths of similar order. Our results demonstrate that radiation is not merely a passive component of accretion flows, but provides a robust and unavoidable trigger for the generation of dynamically significant magnetic fields. Our results provide a physically grounded explanation for the origin of large-scale, structured magnetic fields in and around accretion discs. This mechanism offers a pathway for magnetizing accretion discs and their outflows without invoking externally supplied magnetic flux, with broad implications for X-ray binaries, active galactic nuclei and other transients such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)."}

Our analysis reveals that the QPO in the source exhibits two mutually convertible lag-energy modes: \"hard lag\" and \"soft lag\". Despite different lag characteristics, the energy dependency of the root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the QPO under both modes are consistent, suggesting the two types of QPO originate from the same physical mechanism. By performing a spectral analysis, we further find a correlation between time-lag modes and spectral states: the soft lag mode typically corresponds to harder X-ray spectra and higher blackbody temperatures. Through comprehensive comparison of multiple theoretical models, we propose that the relativistic precession model (RPM) of the corona provides a plausible qualitative explanation for the observed complex phenomena, including time-lag mode transitions, and variations of spectral hardness and QPO signal strength."}

They are key $γ$-ray sources providing a unique laboratory for studying extreme particle acceleration and plasma physics. Variability in $γ$-ray emission is an important signature that may constrain the size of the emission region and the physical processes driving flares. However, current large-scale $γ$-ray catalogs, such as the Fermi-LAT 4LAC-DR3, typically characterize variability only on long timescales (yearly or 60-day), lacking necessary constraints on short-term behavior from days to weeks. To address this, we systematically characterize $γ$-ray variability in AGNs across short timescales: 3-day, 7-day (weekly), and 30-day (monthly). We present a preliminary catalogue of variable AGN based on light curves from the Fermi-LAT Light Curve Repository. We show that the variability amplitude ($σ_{\\rm NXS}^{2}$) presents similar values across different timescales, potentially increasing for a subsample of sources as the observation timescale increases. This high-cadence analysis reinforces the known dichotomy between flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), with FSRQs consistently exhibiting stronger variability. By identifying the most luminous and variable sources at each timescale, we highlight key targets for follow-up with next-generation observatories such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), ASTRI Mini-Array, and the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO), where strong short-term variability suggests highly compact emission zones and extreme particle acceleration efficiency. This catalogue contributes to the understanding of high-energy outflows in AGN jets and provides a foundation for optimizing observational strategies through a unified variability metric across timescales."}

The first two chapters discuss the emission of Short GRB (SGRB) from binary mergers surrounded by a strong magnetic field.

A rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized neutron star (millisecond magnetar) is the primary source of strong magnetic fields ranging from $10^{13}~\\rm to ~ 10^{16} G$. The decay of the magnetic field could power electromagnetic radiation, especially X-rays and gamma rays from NSs or NS-BH mergers as their primary sources.

In the next two chapters, we reviewed the BH interiors to understand the nature of black hole interior information and evaporation from its initial to final phases via entropy variation. The evolution relation obtained from two types of entropy gives diverse understandings of the evaporation of BHs under Hawking radiation.\n  3. The fifth Chapter is related to BH configuration (information) entropy and the thermodynamic phase transition of $f(R)$ BH. Here, we consider a d$-$dimensional black hole (BH) in $f(R)$ gravity and analyze the effect of modified gravity on critical point parameters, the difference in number densities, and configuration entropy during the BH phase transition phenomenon. These results were also compared with charged AdS BH, the holographic dual of van der Waal's fluid, and hence the BH in modified gravity."}

On the other hand, the arrival directions at Earth of neutrons point directly to their origin. The emission of UHECRs from a source is expected to be accompanied by the production of neutrons in its vicinity through interactions with ambient matter and radiation. Since free neutrons travel a mean distance $d/\\text{kpc}=9.2(E/\\text{EeV})$ before decaying, a neutron flux in the EeV range could be detected on Earth from sources of UHECRs in our Galaxy. Using cosmic-ray data from the Phase\\,I of the Surface Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory, we search for neutron fluxes from Galactic candidate sources. We select more than 1000 objects of astrophysical interest, stacking them into target sets. The targets all have declinations within the exposure of the Observatory, ranging from $-90^\\circ$ up to $+45^\\circ$ for energies above 1 EeV (and up to $+20^\\circ$ for energies down to 0.1 EeV). Given that a neutron air shower is indistinguishable from a proton one, there is a significant background due to cosmic rays. A neutron flux from the direction of a candidate source would be identified by a celestial density of events that significantly exceeds the expected density of cosmic rays for that direction. No significant excess is found at any tested target direction, and an upper limit on the neutron flux is calculated for each candidate source."}

In this work, a novel approach is introduced to study a sample of seven LL~GRBs with their multi-wavelength observations to investigate leptohadronic processes during their prompt emission phases. The relative energy densities in magnetic fields, non-thermal electrons, and protons are constrained, with the latter defining the cosmic-ray (CR) loading factor. Our results suggest that LL~GRBs exhibit diverse emission processes, as confirmed by a machine-learning analysis of the fitted parameters. Across the seven LL~GRBs, we find the posterior medians of the CR loading factor in the range of $ξ_p \\sim 0.2$--$1.6$. GRB~060218 and GRB~100316D, the lowest-luminosity bursts ($L_{γ, \\rm iso} \\sim 10^{46}$-$10^{47}\\rm~erg~s^{-1}$) consistent with the shock-breakout (SBO) scenario, yield the highest CR loading factor and therefore are expected to produce neutrinos more efficiently. Our model predicts the expected number of neutrino signals that are consistent with current limits but would be detectable with next-generation neutrino observatories. These results strengthen the case for LL~GRBs as promising sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and motivate real-time searches for coincident LL~GRB and neutrino events. Next-generation X-ray and MeV facilities will be critical for identifying more LL~GRBs and strengthening their role in multi-messenger astrophysics."}

Successive shock regimes in shock-breakout candidates, most notably low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (LL GRBs), naturally introduce distinct physical environments producing a multi-component neutrino flux extending from 10 TeV to the UHE regime. Integrating prompt and afterglow phases within a unified dynamical framework yields a self-consistent explanation for this broadband emission. In this work, we discuss this framework, building on MWL observations. We show that the prompt emission from GRB~060218-like events accounts for $\\gtrsim 10\\%$ of the diffuse flux at 100~TeV, while GRB~100316D-like configurations predict a distinct flux peak near $10^{-9}\\rm~GeV~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~sr^{-1}$ at 100~PeV, providing a physical interpretation for the 220 PeV KM3-230213A event. This decoupling explains the lack of low-energy counterparts for individual UHE detections while maintaining consistency with the total diffuse neutrino flux. Ultimately, this framework identifies SBO-like LL~GRBs as a unifying origin for these phenomena, providing a physical link across a wide band from 10 TeV to EeV energies testable by next-generation observatories, including GRAND, IceCube-Gen2, and RNO-G."}

Using 10 years of publicly available IceCube data, we performed a systematic population analysis of X-ray-bright and gamma-ray-bright AGN to evaluate the extent to which this diffuse flux could originate from these sources. We find that gamma-ray-bright blazars can account for no more than 16\\% of IceCube's total diffuse flux. Although we find no evidence of neutrino emission from gamma-ray-bright, non-blazar AGN, we cannot exclude the possibility that these sources contribute significantly to the diffuse flux. In contrast, we report (pre-trials) evidence of neutrino emission from several nearby, X-ray-bright, Seyfert-type AGN, including \\mbox{NGC 1068} ($4.9σ$), SWIFT J1041.4-1740 ($2.6σ$), SWIFT J0202.4+6824A/B ($2.6σ$), SWIFT J0744.0+2914 (2.6$σ$), NGC 4151 ($2.5σ$), and NGC 3079 ($2.5σ$). Although not fully conclusive, these results suggest that IceCube may be detecting neutrinos from a larger population of Seyfert galaxies. The fact that these sources are not gamma-ray bright indicates that their neutrino production must be taking place in optically thick environments, such as in the coronae surrounding these galaxies' supermassive black holes. We also identify a $4.2σ$ correlation between the neutrinos detected by IceCube and members of the Swift-BAT catalog of X-ray-bright AGN, although this correlation is dominated by NGC 1068. We estimate that this class of sources contributes between 11.2\\% and the entirety of IceCube's total diffuse neutrino flux. These results strengthen the emerging case for the prevalence of gamma-ray-obscured AGN as significant sources of high-energy neutrinos."}
