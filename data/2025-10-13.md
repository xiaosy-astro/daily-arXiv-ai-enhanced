Abstract: We review the state of the evidence for the existence and observational
appearance of supermassive black hole binaries. Such objects are expected from
standard hierarchical galaxy evolution to form after two galaxies, each
containing a supermassive black hole, have merged, in the centre of the merger
remnant. A complex interaction is predicted to take place with stars and gas in
the host galaxy, leading to observable signatures in weakly as well as actively
accreting phases. Direct observational evidence is available and shows examples
of dual active galactic nuclei from kpc scales down to parsec scales.
Signatures of possibly closer supermassive black hole binaries may be seen in
jetted black holes. The interaction with stars and gas in a galaxy
significantly affects the hardening of the binary and hence contributes to
uncertainties of the expected gravitational wave signal. The Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should in the future detect actual mergers.
Before the launch of LISA, pulsar timing arrays may have the best chance to
detect a gravitational wave signal from supermassive black hole binaries. The
first signs of the combined background of inspiralling objects might have been
seen already.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了赫拉克勒斯X-1的吸积盘风，利用XRISM和多观测站的协同观测首次实现了对风垂直结构的时间分辨分析，并发现风速随高度增加而上升，同时检测到一个在轨道周期中出现的新风成分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确测量X射线双星吸积盘风的质量流出率具有挑战性，因为对三维风结构的理解存在不确定性。大多数研究仅使用吸收线光谱学，只能提供单一视线的风流线信息。赫拉克勒斯X-1的特殊性在于其扭曲的进动吸积盘提供了多种视线，从而规避了这一限制。

Method: 本研究通过一个大规模的协同观测活动，使用XRISM/Resolve的高精度光谱学进行时间分辨分析，并结合XMM-Newton、NuSTAR和Chandra等观测设备的数据，探讨吸积盘风的垂直结构特性。通过纠正轨道运动对观测的影响，研究人员能够分析风速随高度的变化以及风柱密度和电离参数的演化。

Result: 观测结果表明，随着风从吸积盘上升，速度从250 km/s增加到600 km/s。风的柱密度随高度降低，但电离参数变化较弱，与风在扩展过程中冻结的假设一致。此外，研究还检测到一种新的轨道依赖性风成分，这种成分仅在赫拉克勒斯X-1被次星遮挡的轨道周期中短暂出现。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了吸积盘风随高度演化的基本趋势，并揭示了吸积盘风结构中可能存在第二成分，进一步加深了我们对X射线双星系统演化过程中物质抛射机制的理解。

Abstract: X-ray binary accretion disk winds can carry away a significant fraction of
the originally infalling matter and hence strongly affect the accretion flow
and the long-term evolution of the binary system. However, accurate
measurements of their mass outflow rates are challenging due to uncertainties
in our understanding of the 3D wind structure. Most studies employ absorption
line spectroscopy that only gives us a single sightline through the wind
streamlines. Hercules X-1 is a peculiar X-ray binary which allows us to avoid
this issue, as its warped, precessing accretion disk naturally presents a range
of sightlines through the vertical structure of its disk wind. Here we present
the first results from a large, coordinated campaign on Her X-1 led by the new
XRISM observatory and supported by XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and Chandra. We perform a
time-resolved analysis and constrain the properties of the wind vertical
structure. Thanks to the precision spectroscopy of XRISM/Resolve, we directly
detect the Her X-1 orbital motion in the evolution of the outflow velocity.
After correcting for this effect, we observe an increase in velocity from 250
km/s to 600 km/s as the wind rises to greater heights above the disk. The wind
column density decreases with height, as expected, but its ionization parameter
only evolves weakly, and is consistent with freezing out as the wind expands
away. Additionally, we detect a new orbital dependence of the wind properties,
revealing a likely second wind component that appears only briefly after the
eclipse of Her X-1 by the secondary star.

Abstract: X-ray emission is generally believed to be one of the major heating sources
for the optical modulation in redback pulsar binaries as we have seen similar
phenomena in many low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). While, e.g., MeV/GeV
gamma-rays from the neutron stars are also possible heating sources, X-ray
observations are currently much more sensitive, and therefore, joint
optical--X-ray data are observationally unique on the irradiation mechanism
investigation. Using 18 X-ray/B-band simultaneous XMM-Newton observations (717
ks in total) of the redback system PSR J1023+0038 taken during the LMXB state,
we find a general trend that the amplitude of the B-band orbital modulation was
lower when the observed X-ray flux was higher. Depending on the analysis method
adopted, the statistical significance of the anti-correlation can be from
1.7sigma to 3.1sigma. We also extended the analysis to the GeV gamma-ray band
using the Fermi-LAT data, but the result is insignificant to claim any
relations. Moreover, another X-ray/optical correlation regarding the low modes
of the system was found in some of the \textit{XMM-Newton} observations, and
the astrophysical reason behind is currently unclear yet. These
anti-correlations likely suggest that the irradiation is generally stronger
when the X-ray flux is in a fainter state, indicating that there is a more
dominant irradiation source than the X-ray emission.

Abstract: Pulse-profile modeling (PPM) of thermal X-ray emission from rotation-powered
millisecond pulsars enables simultaneous constraints on the mass $M$, radius
$R$, and hence the equation of state of cold, dense matter. However, Bayesian
PPM has faced a hard accuracy-speed bottleneck: current production resolutions
used to keep inference tractable can under-resolve extreme hotspot geometries
and bias the waveform computation, whereas the higher resolutions that remove
this bias push forward models to minutes per evaluation, making inference
impractical. We break this trade-off with, to our knowledge, the first public
GPU-accelerated X-ray PPM framework that matches established benchmarks to
within $\sim10^{-3}$ relative accuracy even for extreme geometries, while
collapsing minutes-long high-fidelity computations to $2$--$5$ ms on an RTX
4080 ($10^{3}$--$10^{4}\times$ speedups), enabling posterior exploration at
resolutions and complexities previously out of reach. We further uncover a bias
near the interpolation boundaries of atmosphere lookup tables, demonstrate it
with two diagnostic tests, and counter it with a mixed-order interpolator.
Together, these advances enlarge the feasible hotspot model space and reduce
key systematics in PPM, strengthening inferences for current and future X-ray
missions.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了AGN吸积盘中二进制系统与单个黑洞的相互作用，发现盘中气体对二进制系统的影响取决于其轨道离心率。形状为圆的二进制系统通常在合并前达到自转-轨道对齐，而高离心率的二进制则因快速的引力波吸积而无法对齐，导致升高的$oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{χ}}}}}}}}}}}}}}_{	ext{eff}}$分布更加各向同性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AGN吸积盘中二进制黑洞的动态行为及其对合并事件的影响，以更好地理解通过引力波观测识别AGN嵌入式合并候选者的机制。

Method: 采用后牛顿N体模拟，研究接近平面的二进制-单体相遇，并采用基于气体驱动的对齐经验模型来表征AGN嵌入式合并的$oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{χ}}}}_{	ext{eff}}$-离心率相关性。

Result: 发现近圆形二进制在合并前通常会达到自转-轨道对齐，而高离心率二进制在引力波吸积快速时无法对齐，导致$oldsymbol{χ}}_{	ext{eff}}$分布更各向同性。

Conclusion: 论文阐述了二进制离心率和$oldsymbol{oldsymbol{oldsymbol{χ}}}}_{	ext{eff}}$在AGN盘中的相互作用，指出了这可能是解释像GW190521和GW231123这样的大质量事件的新机制。

Abstract: The disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a natural environment
where stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can dynamically pair, undergo repeated
interactions, and eventually merge. It is commonly assumed that gas accretion
will both efficiently spin up disk-embedded black holes and align the orbits of
embedded binaries with the disk plane, leading to mergers with preferentially
positive effective spin parameters ($\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$). Such predictions
have motivated the use of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ as a diagnostic for identifying
candidate AGN-embedded mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave
catalog. In this work, we perform post-Newtonian $N$-body simulations of nearly
planar binary-single encounters and apply an empirically motivated, gas-driven
alignment prescription to characterize the expected
$\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$-eccentricity correlations of AGN-embedded mergers. By
comparing the alignment and gravitational-wave inspiral timescales, we identify
the regions of parameter space, across both disk location and binary
properties, where full disk-spin-orbit alignment is effective and where it is
not. We find that quasi-circular binaries typically align by the time they
merge, supporting the standard picture of spin-orbit aligned orientations. By
contrast, eccentric binaries (with in-band eccentricity
$e_{10\mathrm{Hz}}\gtrsim 0.1$) typically inspiral too quickly for gas torques
to act, preserving the post-encounter spin-orbit misalignments and yielding
more isotropic $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ distributions when disk densities and
torque efficiencies are modest. This interplay naturally establishes a
correlation between binary eccentricity and $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ in AGN disks,
highlighting a new key observable of the AGN channel and a potential
explanation for massive events such as GW190521 and GW231123.

Motivation: 了解快射电暴（FRBs）和宇宙射线（CRs）之间的潜在关联，探索FRBs作为宇宙射线源的可能性。

Method: 研究通过分析FRB-like电磁脉冲的作用，探讨局部粒子加速机制，使用粒子-粒子模拟（PIC）验证能量标度预测，同时研究FRB扩散过程中的能量谱形成。

Result: 发现超高能中性等离子体片通过FRB脉冲前缘侵蚀形成，提出了两种离子加速机制（wakefield和piston），预测的能量标度与PIC模拟一致，且FRB扩散过程中自然产生与宇宙射线指数相似的能量谱。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解FRBs和CRs之间的关系提供了新机制，强调了联合观测在探索极端宇宙现象中的重要性，并推动物理学多信使天文学的发展。

Abstract: Two extreme events in the universe, fast radio bursts (FRBs) and cosmic rays
(CRs), could be corelated, where FRBs with extreme field strength near their
sources may contribute to CRs. This study investigates localized particle
acceleration driven by FRB-like ultra-relativistic electromagnetic pulses. It
is found ultra-high energy neutral plasma sheets form constantly via the front
erosion of an FRB pulse. There are two ion acceleration regimes depending upon
the field strength and the plasma density: the wakefield regime dominated by
charge separation fields, and the piston regime driven by the
$\mathbf{V}\times\mathbf{B}$ force of the pulses. The predicted energy scalings
align well with particle-in-cell simulations. A power-law energy spectrum
naturally arises with an index close to the CRs during FRB diffusion outward.
Joint observations of FRBs and CRs may provide an opportunity to understand
these extreme events and advance the development of multi-messenger astronomy.

Result: 模型显示，低质量端的峰值由常见包络通道或稳定质量转移通道（取决于质量转移的稳定性标准）贡献，而高质量端的峰值由CHE通道贡献。模型预测的合并率和检测率对物理参数选择高度敏感。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在解释双黑洞合并观测数据时需要考虑不同形成通道及其物理参数的影响，以更准确地理解双黑洞系统的形成历史。

Abstract: Gravitational wave detectors are observing an increasing number of binary
black hole (BBH) mergers, revealing a bimodal mass distribution of BBHs, which
hints at diverse formation histories for these systems. Using the rapid binary
population synthesis code MOBSE, we simulate a series of population synthesis
models that include chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE). By considering
metallicity-specific star formation and selection effects, we compare the
intrinsic merger rates and detection rates of each model with observations. We
find that the observed peaks in the mass distribution of merging BBHs at the
low-mass end (10\msun) and the high-mass end (35\msun) are contributed by the
common envelope channel or stable mass transfer channel (depending on the
stability criteria for mass transfer) and the CHE channel, respectively, in our
model. The merger rates and detection rates predicted by our model exhibit
significant sensitivity to the choice of physical parameters. Different models
predict merger rates ranging from 15.4 to $96.7\,\rm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ at
redshift $z$ = 0.2, and detection rates ranging from 22.2 to
148.3$\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ under the assumption of a detectable redshift range of
$z \le$ 1.0.

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the main targets for the observations of
the MAGIC telescopes. As a result of the effort in improving the sensitivity of
the instrument and the automatic follow-up strategy, MAGIC detected two GRBs in
the very-high-energy (VHE, $E>100$ GeV) range, namely GRB 190114C and GRB
201216C. In GRB 190114C ($z=0.42$), the data collected by MAGIC revealed a new
emission component at sub-TeV energies in the afterglow of the GRB. The very
rich multi-wavelength dataset, spanning 17 orders of magnitude in energy,
allowed to perform a detailed modelling of the broadband emission. The
multi-wavelength data could be modelled within a one-zone synchrotron-self
Compton scenario with internal $\gamma-\gamma$ absorption, where the model
parameters are compatible with those found in previous GRB afterglow studies
below GeV energies. Similarly, GRB 201216C broadband emission could be
explained using the same model, although the amount of simultaneous
multi-wavelength data is reduced with respect to GRB 190114C. In particular,
GRB 201216C challenged the current MAGIC detection potential, as its redshift
was determined to be $z=1.1$, strongly reducing the observed gamma-ray flux but
making it the most distant source detected at VHE. These two detections,
accompanied by evidence of VHE emission from a few more GRBs, opened up new
questions such as the presence of sub-TeV emission in different classes and
phases of GRBs. In this contribution we will present the status of the MAGIC
GRB follow-up program, with an highlight on its detected GRBs. Moreover we will
show the results on the GRBs observed by MAGIC from 2013 to 2019 with no
evidence of VHE emission, in particular for those with simultaneous X-ray
observations and redshift $z<2$. We will discuss the implications of these
results for GRB physics and the challenges and prospects for future GRB
observations with MAGIC.

Abstract: We present Effelsberg 100-m telescope observations of the hyperactive
repeating fast radio burst source FRB 20240110A, discovered by CHIME/FRB in
January 2024. Using the Ultra BroadBand (UBB) receiver, spanning 1.3-6.0 GHz,
we detected over 700 unique bursts across four observing epochs. A
comprehensive analysis of their temporal and spectral properties reveals four
distinct spectro-temporal morphologies, including simple, complex and
frequency-drifting structures. No bursts were detected across the full UBB
band, confirming the band-limited emission typical of repeating FRBs. We find
modest frequency evolution in burst widths but constant fractional bandwidths,
and strong variability in burst rates that may be influenced by scintillation.
The waiting-time distributions indicate predominantly independent burst events,
with occasional clustering suggesting a characteristic emission timescale of
$\sim$10 ms. Additionally, this study presents a multi-frequency analysis of
waiting-time distributions, offering new insights into the complex frequency
drifts commonly observed in repeating FRBs. These broadband observations
provide a detailed view of the frequency-dependent burst behavior of FRB
20240110A and offer insights into the variability and temporal structure of
repeating FRB emission.

*Anne Inkenhaag,Andrew J. Levan,Andrew Mummery,Peter G. Jonker*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究分析了AT 2018cow这一快速蓝光学瞬变现象，通过新的哈勃空间望远镜UV数据，确认其光学亮度没有显著衰减，而UV仅轻微衰减，支持了吸积盘模型，推测为潮汐破坏事件，而非超新星相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AT 2018cow拥有丰富的多波段观测数据，但其物理本质和起源仍未达成共识，因此需要进一步的观测来明确其性质。

Method: 使用哈勃空间望远镜获取了AT 2018cow在后期的UV数据，并将其与先前发表的吸积盘模型进行比较。

Result: 新数据表明光学亮度自上次观测以来没有显著衰减，UV仅轻微衰减，与吸积盘模型预测相符，与交互超新星模型不符。

Conclusion: 这些结果为AT 2018cow是一次潮汐破坏事件提供了证据，同时表明未来更长时间的观测可以更有效地排除超新星相互作用的可能性。

Abstract: The Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient (LFBOT) AT 2018cow is the prototype
of its class with an extensive set of multi-wavelength observations. Despite a
rich data set there is, still, no consensus about the physical nature and
origin of this event. AT 2018cow remained UV bright 2-4 years after the
explosion, which points at an additional energy injection source, most likely
from an accretion disk. We present additional late time UV data obtained with
the Hubble Space Telescope, to show there is no significant fading in the
optical since the last epoch and only marginal fading in the UV. The new UV
data points match the predictions of previously published accretion disk
models, where the disk is assumed to form from the tidal disruption of a low
mass star by an intermediate mass black hole. This consistency provides
evidence that AT 2018cow could indeed be a tidal disruption event. The marginal
decay is in contrast with the predictions of light curves produced by
interacting supernovae. The difference between expectations for disc emission
and interacting supernovae will further increase with time, making data at even
later times a route to robustly rule out interaction between supernova ejecta
and circumstellar material.

Abstract: The radioactive decay of unstable nuclei created in the rapid neutron capture
process release a large amount of $\gamma$-rays. When the ejecta is optically
thick, these $\gamma$-rays may contribute to an associated kilonova. Once
transparent, prominent spectral features will be directly observable in current
and future $\gamma$-ray detectors. In this work, we study and compare the
$\gamma$-ray spectra of a limited, weak, strong, and extended $r$-process
across a broad timescale, identifying the nuclei which significantly
contribute. We discuss these findings in the context of observability, noting
that there are several practical challenges to connecting observed signatures
to specific nuclei. However, if these challenges can be overcome, direct
observation of $\gamma$-rays from $r$-process sites can provide insight into
the fundamental physics underpinning the $r$-process.
