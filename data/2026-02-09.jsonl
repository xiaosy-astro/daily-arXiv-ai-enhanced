This population is also the most sensitive to SMBH seeding and early growth models. In this work we construct a semi-empirical model for the redshift evolution of the TDE rate under multiple SMBH mass function prescriptions, and show that the observed redshift-dependent rate of TDEs is very sensitive to the SMBH mass function and its evolution with redshift. We further incorporate galaxy-scale processes that evolve with redshift -- namely, increasing galaxy nuclear stellar densities, enhanced galaxy-galaxy merger rates, dust obscuration, and a possible top-heavy IMF at early cosmic times -- and quantify their combined impact on the TDE rate. We find that including these effects generally results in a volumetric TDE rate that increases with redshift until a maximum near cosmic noon, before declining at higher redshift where SMBHs that can disrupt stars become increasingly scarce. We forecast TDE rates in the Rubin LSST and the Roman High Latitude Time Domain Survey, alongside expectations for serendipitous TDE rates in the JWST COSMOS-Web survey. Finally, we provide a methodology for using a flux-limited survey of TDEs in LSST to directly constrain the redshift evolution of the SMBH mass function."}

In particular, we consider the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, Janis-Newman-Winicour, and Bardeen black hole space-times from General Relativity, as well as a black hole solution from Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, a hairy black hole solution from Horndeski theory, and a Yukawa-like black hole from $f(\\mathscr{R})$ gravity. To constrain model parameters, we use the most recent publicly available observational data of the S2 star orbit, namely astrometric measurements, spectroscopic data, and the pericentre advance measured by the GRAVITY Collaboration. We further perform a consistent Bayesian comparison of models, calculating the log-Bayes factor of each space-time with respect to the Schwarzschild solution. Our results show that the currently available data indicate no statistically significant preference among the space-times considered. The Bardeen and Yukawa-like models are indistinguishable from Schwarzschild within current uncertainties, while the Reissner-Nordström, Janis-Newman-Winicour, Horndeski and Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton geometries show at most weak and non-decisive strength of evidence under the adopted priors and likelihood choices."}

We analyze LVK data coincident with long GRBs detected by Fermi's GRB Monitor and Swift's Burst Alert Telescope when at least two gravitational-wave observatories were running.

In this scenario, the envelope of the prompt light curve follows the time-dependent mass-supply history to the central engine, associated with stellar collapse and, where applicable, fallback accretion, whose early-time onset can be approximated by $\\dot{M}\\propto t^{0-1/2}$ and which subsequently may decay as $\\dot{M}\\propto t^{-5/3}$, producing a photon count rate with a single fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED)-like profile. In general, the prompt-emission envelope is regulated by a time-dependent mass supply to the central engine, while internal shocks produce the rapid variability. Since we only aim to introduce this framework here, we focus on the simplest single-FRED shape of the prompt emission profiles, while more complex cases involving multiple episodes and interacting shocks will be explored in forthcoming studies. The model indicates correlations between spectral evolution, FRED-pulse narrowing at high energies, and the mass-supply-controlled envelope. Stochastic Lorentz factor variations of ejected mass- or rate-driven shells, superimposed on the Accretion-Modulated envelope, explain the coexistence of smooth global trends and irregular short-timescale features, such as the widths of individual pulses in long GRB light curves, offering diagnostic tools for probing the inner engine activity."}

Although a full description of the continuous and transient emission from blazars seems to require more sophisticated scenarios, particle acceleration and loss mechanisms can be approximately described within the simple leptonic one-zone framework, enabling a systematic study of their impact on the observable properties of multiwavelength flare light curves. Our goal is to identify characteristic signatures in these light curve profiles that permit one to discriminate between the main physical processes situated inside the relativistic jet and commonly invoked to explain blazar flares. The present study exclusively focuses on modeling rapid flares from BL Lac type objects, which can be described within the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission scenario. Combinations of several commonly employed mechanisms to describe the gain and loss of energetic particles in onezone models during flaring events are studied in a systematic way: particle injection; diffusive shock and stochastic acceleration and reacceleration; particle escape; adiabatic losses; radiative losses through synchrotron and inverse-Compton radiation. The current study is limited to the case of \"hard-sphere\" scattering. A large variety of light curve shapes arises from the different scenarios under study. Characteristic signatures, in particular energy-dependent time delays and differences in the shapes of the rising part of the flare, should allow the distinction to be made between different injection and acceleration scenarios, given the availability of sufficiently high-quality multiwavelength data sets. This is illustrated with a simplified application to a flare event from the blazar Mrk 421."}

We show that the requirement that a second-generation (2G) remnant be retained, and subsequently undergo a dynamical encounter, places strong constraints on the mass of the cluster. Using a Plummer model as a readily interpretable baseline, we derive analytic scaling relations between the peak of the inferred host mass posterior, the GW-driven recoil velocity of the remnant, and the parameters that determine the structure of the host. We then perform exact numerical marginalization over thermal and recoil velocities, angles, and cluster structure parameters, to infer the host-mass posterior. We apply our framework to putative hierarchical mergers GW241011 and GW241110, and infer the masses of their hosts on a single-event basis. We find that these are consistent with either heavy globular clusters or nuclear star clusters, with inferred masses spanning $10^{5.7 - 7.7} M_{\\odot}$ at $68\\%$ confidence depending on the 2G recoil velocity distribution used."}

In this case, the geometric properties of the metric and their dynamical consequences for particle trajectories are systematically studied, with a specific focus on circular orbits together with their existence criteria and stability constraints. Also, the effective potential and the corresponding effective force are constructed to quantify the influence of rotation and embedding parameters on the attractive and repulsive sectors of the gravitational interaction. Closed-form expressions for orbital frequencies as measured by a distant observer are derived, enabling a quantitative analysis of relativistic precession phenomena, including periastron advance and Lense-Thirring precession. Furthermore, we conduct general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of BHL accretion onto rotating embedded BHs. In addition, within the framework of the BHL accretion mechanism, the numerical solution of the GRH equations shows that the embedding parameter αsystematically modifies the morphology of the shock cone formed around embedded BHs compared to the Kerr model. In particular, a wider opening angle of the cone is produced, the compression of matter in the post-shock region is weakened, and the dynamical variability of the flow is enhanced. The time-dependent mass accretion rate exhibits increasing oscillation amplitudes and long-term variations with increasing α, while these amplitudes are found to be suppressed by the frame-dragging effect associated with the BH spin parameter. At the same time, increasing values of $α$ lead to a strengthening of the QPO frequencies formed around embedded BHs in the LFQPO regime, enhancing their observability and increasing the likelihood of detecting commensurate frequency ratios such as 3:2."}

This analysis utilizes the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma ray Observatory to indirectly search for dark matter (DM) by studying gamma ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Selected for their high ratio of dark matter to baryonic matter, dSphs are useful for this type of search owing to the low background emission. In comparison to previous HAWC studies, we significantly improve our sensitivity to DM from dSphs due to improvements to our event reconstruction and reduced hadronic contamination. We expanded the number of dSphs studied, DM annihilation channels into the Standard Model (SM), and the amount of data collected on each previously studied dSph. We searched for DM signals in each dSph using the latest version of the algorithms used to reconstruct data from the primary detector of the HAWC instrument. We report that we do not detect evidence of DM from dSphs, so we place upper limits for the velocity-weighted DM annihilation cross-section ($\\langleσv \\rangle$) on the order of $10^{-23}~\\text{cm}^3\\text{s}^{-1}$ for a DM mass range of $1-10^4$ TeV."}

In this work, we investigate the CCF of the Z-source GX 349+2 using an XMM-Newton observation. We noted that asymmetric CCFs with lags of a few hundred secondsbetween soft and hard band LCs in the horizontal branch, whereas CCFs remained symmetric in normal and flaring branches. We also performed a CCF study during the flux transition duration and observed lags of the order of a few tens to hundreds of seconds. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to assess the robustness of these CCFs, confirming their significance at a 95% confidence level. Spectral analysis during the flux transitions further suggests that the inner accretion disk extends close to the last stable orbit. We propose that the observed hard lags arise from the readjustment of the boundary layer/coronal region located near the inner edge of the accretion disk. From the measured lags, we estimate the characteristic size of the boundary layer. We show that the observed lags could also be associated with the depletion timescale of the boundary layer with low viscosity."}
