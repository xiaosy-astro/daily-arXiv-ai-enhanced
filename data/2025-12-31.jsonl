However, the underlying production mechanism --\\textit{hadronic} versus \\textit{leptonic}-- remains uncertain due to the non-detection of coincident neutrinos at IceCube. Indeed, the neutrino flux predicted by the hadronic model for RS Oph was below IceCube sensitivity. T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), a nova similar to RS Oph, is anticipated to undergo an outburst soon. Being closer to Earth (0.8 kpc versus 2.45 kpc for RS Oph), T CrB is expected to yield a higher neutrino flux, making the upcoming outburst a once in a lifetime opportunity to test-and potentially detect-nova neutrinos. In this work, we present the first model-based estimates of the hadronic secondary fluxes from T CrB and assess their detectability with gamma-ray (LHAASO, Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, H.E.S.S., MACE, and HERD) and neutrino (IceCube and KM3NeT) telescopes. We adopt two proton-acceleration mechanisms: (i) an external shock (ES) driven mechanism at the interaction ($10^{13}$ cm) of nova ejecta and the red giant wind, and (ii) magnetic reconnection (MR) near the white dwarf surface ($10^{9}$ cm). The latter, arising deep inside the nova system, will fully absorb gamma-rays while allowing only neutrinos to escape. This could potentially produce neutrino signals hours before the ES origin photons or neutrinos-a unique temporal delay signature. For our benchmark ES model, gamma-rays are detectable across all facilities, while the neutrino detection prospect is poor. Only a tiny upper part of the ES model parameter space is above IceCube/KM3NeT sensitivity. In contrast, both observatories have significantly better prospects for detecting neutrinos in the MR scenario."}

Here, we combine observations of 32 GRBs with positive-to-negative lag transitions to derive a statistically robust constraint on $E_{\\rm QG}$ through hierarchical Bayesian inference. We find that the dominant systematic uncertainty in LIV constraints arises from the intrinsic lag modeling.

By tracking the complex electric field vector for each photon during its atmospheric transport and propagation in general relativistic and birefringent magnetospheres, our Monte Carlo simulation, named MAGTHOMSCATT, allows for capturing the complete polarization properties, including the intricate interplay between linearity and circularity. The new inclusion in MAGTHOMSCATT of quantum electrodynamical influences on polarization in the magnetosphere is presented. We simulate the pulsed and polarized X-ray emission from the outer layers of optically thick, fully ionized atmospheres of neutron stars, with a focus on the radiation emitted from extended polar caps of magnetars, which are the most highly magnetized neutron stars. Using the recent intensity pulse profile data for the magnetar 1RXS J11708-4009, we constrain the geometric parameters, namely the angles between the magnetic axis and the observer's viewing direction relative to the spin axis, as well as the sizes of emission regions. The distributions of these parameters and the best-fit configuration are provided. In addition, we discuss the important impacts of vacuum birefringence in the magnetosphere on increasing the linear polarization degree. A comparison with the case of a weakly magnetized neutron star, RX J0822.0-4300, is also discussed. Our simulation still needs further development, particularly to incorporate the vacuum resonance effect. Nevertheless, the formalism presented here can be employed to constrain geometric parameters for various types of neutron stars."}

They are established sources of 100~TeV gamma rays and are considered promising candidates for cosmic-ray acceleration. Motivated by recent detections of $\\sim 100~$TeV photons from Cygnus~X-1 and $\\sim~$PeV photons from Cygnus~X-3 by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), we employ the Astrophysical Multimessenger Emission Simulator (AMES) to model their multimessenger emission considering compact outflow regions as cosmic-ray accelerators, spanning from radio to ultra-high-energy gamma rays. Our results show that the observed $>$TeV gamma rays can originate from either $pγ$ or $pp$ interactions, depending on the location and physical conditions of the emission region, while also reproducing the lower-energy spectra. The different configurations yield unique, observationally testable predictions. In the $0.1-10$~TeV energy range, where current observations provide only upper limits, they predict either a deep dip, a mild suppression, or a power-law spectrum. Additionally, models involving AU-scale blob regions predict strong variability, while those invoking more extended and static external zones show more stable behavior. We also provide a possible qualitative explanation for the distinct modulation patterns across different energy bands, which relies primarily on changes in the Doppler factor and external $γγ$ absorption. Finally, our neutrino predictions, which properly account for muon and pion cooling effects, reveal a significantly suppressed flux, indicating that detecting these sources may be more challenging than previously anticipated."}

Radio emission has recently been detected in TDEs and is commonly attributed to synchrotron radiation from both wind and jetted outflows. However, several TDEs exhibit bright radio flares at late times, which cannot be easily explained if the wind is launched promptly after the stellar disruption. In this study, we model the radio light curves of TDEs with delayed radio flares using three scenarios: an instantaneous wind, a delayed wind, and a delayed relativistic jet. We show that the instantaneous wind model struggles to reproduce delayed radio flare events, indicating the necessity of an additional delayed outflow component. In contrast, the delayed wind model provides a consistent explanation for the observed radio phenomenology, successfully reproducing events both with and without delayed radio flares. For some delayed radio flare events (e.g., ASASSN-15oi and AT 2019dsg), both the delayed wind and delayed jet models can reproduce the observed radio light curves. The delayed jet model produces x-ray and optical emission that is detectable at typical TDE distances, in contrast to wind-driven scenarios. This highlights how multiwavelength observations offer an effective means of distinguishing among possible outflow mechanisms."}

We model the afterglow and KN, and perform a Bayesian analysis, within the Nuclear physics and Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (NMMA) framework. The KN emission is modeled with the radiative transfer code POSSIS and for afterglow we use the afterglowpy library.

We identified four high-flux states and investigated the possibility of a QPO in the fourth high-flux state (MJD 59482-60832). Using the Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) and Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) methods, we find tentative evidence for a month-scale QPO; however, its detection significance is limited by the small number of observed cycles. With a sufficiently long data set, the QPO may be detected with higher significance in the future. We further explored possible physical origins of this potential QPO and examined several models.

In this work, we construct the equations of state (EoS) for DANS matter by employing twelve nuclear matter (NM) models within the covariant density functional (CDF) theory and a self-interacting fermionic model for DM. Using these EoSs as input, we solve the two-fluid Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations to systematically investigate the influence of DM on the global properties of neutron stars (NSs). By incorporating recent observational constraints on NS properties, the maximum DM mass fraction $f_χ^{\\mathrm{max}}$ in DANSs is determined for each NM EoS model.

Consistent sky localization confirms that both trigger events originated from the same astrophysical source. Here, we present a systematic classification and characteristics study of three such cases: GRB 091024A, GRB 110709B, and GRB 220627A. We investigate each trigger episode emission independently using standard classification diagnostics, including duration ($T_{90}$), hardness ratio, minimum variability timescale (MVT), spectral lag ($τ_{\\rm lag}$), peak energy ($E_{\\rm p}$), and energetics. We compare these properties with those of typical long GRBs (LGRBs) and with single-trigger LGRBs that exhibit extended quiescent periods. Our analysis reveals that all sub-bursts from the three double-trigger events consistently lie within the LGRB classification region. These results indicate that double-trigger GRBs are not a physically distinct subclass, but rather products of LGRB central engines that undergo extended dormancy and subsequent reactivation."}
