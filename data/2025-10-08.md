Result: 模拟显示低质量HeCO白矮星合并时发生不完全的氦壳层燃烧，导致不显著产生56Ni的微弱迅速演化的瞬变，同时可能形成高速PG-1159型恒星。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了我们对白矮星合并及其在核合成和恒星演化中的作用的理解，这些瞬变可能在未来的宽视场调查中被探测到，并可能解释部分暗淡的热核超新星。

Abstract: We present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of mergers between
low-mass hybrid HeCO white dwarfs (WDs), offering new insights into the
diversity of thermonuclear transients. Unlike previously studied mergers
involving higher-mass HeCO WDs and CO WDs, where helium detonation often
triggers core ignition, our simulations reveal incomplete helium shell
detonations in comparable-mass, lower-mass WD pairs. The result is a faint,
rapidly evolving transient driven by the ejection of intermediate-mass elements
and radioactive isotopes such as $^{48}$Cr and $^{52}$Fe, without significant
$^{56}$Ni production. These transients may be detectable in upcoming wide-field
surveys and could account for a subset of faint thermonuclear supernovae.
Long-term evolution of the merger remnant shows that high-velocity PG-1159-type
stars might be formed through this scenario, similar to normal CO-CO white
dwarf mergers. This work expands our understanding of white dwarf mergers and
their implications for nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution.

Abstract: Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are rare extragalactic events
of unknown origin. Tidal disruptions of white dwarfs by intermediate mass black
holes, mergers of black holes and Wolf-Rayet stars, and failed supernovae are
among the suggestions. In this paper, we explore the viability of very massive
star core-collapse events as the origin of LFBOTs. The appeal of such a model
is that the formation of massive black holes via core collapse may yield
observational signatures that can match the disparate lines of evidence that
point towards both core-collapse and tidal disruption origins for LFBOTs. We
explore the formation rate of massive black holes in population synthesis
models, and compare the metallicities of their progenitors with the observed
metallicities of LFBOT host galaxies. We further examine the composition, mass
loss rates and fallback masses of these stars, placing them in the context of
LFBOT observations. The formation rate of black holes with mass greater than
~30-40Msol is similar to the observed LFBOT rate. The stars producing these
black holes are biased to low metallicity (Z<0.3Zsol), are H and He-poor and
have dense circumstellar media. However, some LFBOTs have host galaxies with
higher metallicities than predicted, and others have denser environments
(plausibly due to late mass loss not captured in the models). We find that
long-lived emission from an accretion disc (as implicated in the prototypical
LFBOT AT2018cow) can plausibly be produced in these events. We conclude that
(very) massive star core-collapse is a plausible explanation for LFBOTs. The
preferred progenitors for LFBOTs in this scenario overlap with those predicted
to produce super-kilonovae. We therefore suggest that LFBOTs are promising
targets to search for super-kilonovae, and that they may contribute
non-negligibly to the r-process enrichment of galaxies.

### [3] [Harnessing the XMM-Newton data: X-ray spectral modelling of 4XMM-DR11 detections and 4XMM-DR11s sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03409)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of four new catalogues based on XMM-Newton's 4XMM-DR11 data, focusing on X-ray spectral analysis of different celestial sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance our understanding of the diverse X-ray sources in the sky by leveraging the latest and improved XMM-Newton data releases, which are essential for astrophysical research.

Method: The authors employed various spectral models (absorbed power law, absorbed blackbody, and others) on the 4XMM-DR11 catalogue data to generate four catalogues. They also used five-band count rates to simulate low-resolution spectra and classified sources into categories like AGN, stars, etc.

Result: Four catalogues were created: one with absorbed power law fits for all detections; one with fits for both power law and blackbody models for unique sources; one using five-band count rates to estimate spectral shapes; and one with detailed spectral analyses for categorized sources. These catalogues provide valuable data for selecting AGN using optical and mid-infrared colours.

Conclusion: The newly released catalogues offer significant scientific value and serve as a foundation for further research in X-ray astrophysics, particularly in the identification and study of AGN.

Abstract: The XMM-Newton X-ray observatory has played a prominent role in astrophysics,
conducting precise and thorough observations of the X-ray sky for the past two
decades. The most recent iteration of the 4XMM catalogue and one of its latest
data releases DR11 mark significant improvements over previous XMM-Newton
catalogues, serving as a cornerstone for comprehending the diverse inhabitants
of the X-ray sky. We employ detections and spectra extracted from the 4XMM-DR11
catalogue, subjecting them to fitting procedures using simple models. Our study
operates within the framework of the XMM2ATHENA project, which focuses on
developing state-of-the-art methods that exploit existing XMM-Newton data. We
introduce and publicly release four catalogues containing measurements derived
from X-ray spectral modelling of sources. The first catalogue encompasses
outcomes obtained by fitting an absorbed power law model to all the extracted
spectra for individual detections within the 4XMM-DR11 dataset. The second
catalogue presents results obtained by fitting both an absorbed power law and
an absorbed blackbody model to all unique physical sources listed in the
4XMM-DR11s catalogue, which documents source detection results from overlapping
XMM-Newton observations. For the third catalogue we use the five band count
rates derived from the pipe line detection of X-ray sources to mimic low
resolution spectra to get a rough estimate of the spectral shape (absorbed
power-law) of all 4XMM-DR11 detections. In the fourth catalogue, we conduct
spectral analyses for the subset of identified sources with extracted spectra,
employing various models based on their classification into categories such as
AGN, stars, X-ray binaries, and cataclysmic variables. The scientific potential
of these catalogues is highlighted by discussing the capabilities of optical
and mid-infrared colours for selecting absorbed AGN. (abridged)

Abstract: We present a new selected sample of 69 Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) for
calibration of radio $\Sigma-D$ relation at 1 GHz. Calibrators with the most
reliable distances were selected through an extensive literature search. The
calibration is performed using kernel smoothing of the selected sample of
calibrators in $\Sigma-D$ plane and an orthogonal offsets fitting procedure. We
use the obtained calibration to derive the distances to 164 Galactic SNRs and
27 new detected SNRs/SNR candidates with none or poor distance estimates. The
analysis given in this paper confirms the expected predictions from our
previous papers that the kernel smoothing method is more reliable for SNR
distance calibration than the orthogonal offset fitting method, except for the
distance determinations of the very low brightness SNRs.

TL;DR: 研究利用耦合级联方程计算不同海拔高度大气中π、K和μ子的通量，为高能宇宙射线和中微子探测器（如EUSO-SPB2）提供背景信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面和气球探测器受大气带电粒子背景干扰，可能掩盖或模仿天体物理信号，需要准确的背景估计。

Method: 基于耦合级联方程，分析能量高于10 GeV的粒子通量，研究地球磁场对轨迹的影响较小的条件。

Result: 提供了角度和能量分辨的通量估计，并讨论了其在探测器背景中的应用。

Conclusion: 结果对当前和未来气球实验数据解释以及切伦科夫和荧光望远镜的触发和屏蔽策略有潜在参考价值。

Abstract: Cosmic rays interacting with the Earth's atmosphere generate extensive air
showers, which produce Cherenkov, fluorescence and radio emissions. These
emissions are key signatures for detection by ground-based, sub-orbital, and
satellite-based telescopes aiming to study high energy cosmic ray and neutrino
events. However, detectors operating at ground and balloon altitudes are also
exposed to a background of atmospheric charged particles, primarily pions,
kaons, and muons, that can mimic or obscure the signals from astrophysical
sources. In this work, we use coupled cascade equations to calculate the
atmospheric pion, kaon and muon fluxes reaching detectors at various altitudes.
Our analysis focuses on energies above 10 GeV, where the influence of the
Earth's magnetic field on particle trajectories is minimal. We provide angular
and energy-resolved flux estimates and discuss their relevance as background
for extensive air shower detection. Our results are potentially relevant for
interpreting data from current and future balloon-borne experiments such as
EUSO-SPB2 and for refining trigger and veto strategies in Cherenkov and
fluorescence telescopes.

### [6] [GRMHD modelling of accretion flow around Sagittarius A$^*$ constrained by EHT measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03602)
*Gargi Sen,Debaprasad Maity,Santabrata Das*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 该研究在广义相对论磁流体动力学（GRMHD）框架下，分析了低角动量吸积流在类星体黑洞周围的稳态行为，成功重现了事件视界望远镜（EHT）对银河中心黑洞Sgr A*在不同半径处磁通量的观测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解释和重现EHT对Sgr A*磁通量的观测结果，研究人员需要深入理解在强引力场中磁化等离子体的行为，尤其是低角动量吸积流的特性。

Method: 通过解决完整的GRMHD方程，研究者探索了能量(${	ext{E}}$)、角动量(${	ext{L}}$)、磁通量($	ext{Φ}$)和等旋转参数($	ext{I}$)的输入参数组，生成了代表黑洞周围物理环境的全球GRMHD吸积解族。

Result: 研究发现，对于广泛的参数值，模型在不同半径处成功复现EHT推断的磁通量强度，误差范围约为10%，这表明模型能够准确描述接近黑洞视界的吸积物理。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了将近黑洞吸积物理与EHT观测结果相结合的自我一致性框架，为理解旋转黑洞周围的吸积过程提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: We study low angular momentum, advective accretion flows around a Kerr black
hole within the framework of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD)
in the steady state. By solving the full set of GRMHD equations, we aim to
provide a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of magnetized plasma in
the strong gravity regime near a rotating black hole. The accretion solutions
are obtained for a set of input parameters, namely energy (${\cal E}$), angular
momentum (${\cal L}$), magnetic flux ($\Phi$), and isorotation parameter ($I$).
By systematically varying these parameters, we generate a family of global
GRMHD accretion solutions that characterize the physical environment around the
black hole. Using this approach, we investigate whether the inferred magnetic
field strengths reported by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) for Sagittarius
A$^*$ at various radii can be reproduced. We find that, for a broad range of
parameter values, our model successfully recovers the EHT inferred magnetic
field strengths with an accuracy of approximately $10\%$, offering a
self-consistent framework for interpreting near-horizon accretion physics.

Abstract: Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is the next-generation
ground-based gamma-ray observatory operating in the energy range from 20 GeV up
to 300 TeV, with two sites in La Palma (Spain) and Paranal (Chile). It will
consist of telescopes of three sizes, covering different parts of the large
energy range. We report on the performance of Large-Sized Telescope prototype
(LST-1) in the detection and characterization of extragalactic gamma-ray
sources, with a focus on the reconstructed gamma-ray spectra and variability of
classical bright BL Lacertae objects, which were observed during the early
commissioning phase of the instrument. LST-1 data from known bright gamma-ray
blazars - Markarian 421, Markarian 501, 1ES 1959+650, 1ES 0647+250, and PG
1553+113 - were collected between July 10, 2020, and May 23, 2022, covering a
zenith angle range of 4 deg to 57 deg. The reconstructed light curves were
analyzed using a Bayesian block algorithm to distinguish the different activity
phases of each blazar. Simultaneous Fermi-LAT data were utilized to reconstruct
the broadband $\gamma$-ray spectra for the sources during each activity phase.
High-level reconstructed data in a format compatible with gammapy are provided
together with measured light curves and spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
for several bright blazars and an interpretation of the observed variability in
long and short timescales. Simulations of historical flares are generated to
evaluate the sensitivity of LST-1. This work represents the first milestone in
monitoring bright BL Lacertae objects with a CTAO telescope.

### [8] [Limiting the Yukawa Gravity through the Black Hole Shadows of Sgr A* and M87*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04210)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过观测超大质量黑洞的阴影，可以检验修改引力理论，如Yukawa引力，特别是在极端强引力场下的有效性。

Method: 利用EHT对M87*和Sgr A*的观测数据，结合Keck和VLBI的不同先验，研究Yukawa黑洞阴影的大小与参数λ和κ的关系，进行参数约束。

Result: Sgr A* 的阴影在λ>1 AU时给出κ的约束为-0.04^{+0.09}_{-0.10}（Keck先验）和-0.08^{+0.09}_{-0.06}（VLTI先验）；当λ减小到0.1 AU时，约束变弱；M87*仅能在λ>1.5×10^4 AU时约束κ为-0.01^{+0.17}_{-0.17}。

Conclusion: 当前EHT观测未发现显著偏离GR的现象，但下一代VLBI技术如ngEHT和BHEX有望通过测量第二环光子来更精确地约束Yukawa参数，提高强场引力理论检验的能力。

Abstract: Recently, the \textit{EHT} collaboration unveiled the shadow images of the
supermassive black hole (SMBH) M87* and Sgr A*, with angular radii of
$42\pm3$\,$\mu$as and $48.7\pm7.0$\,$\mu$as, respectively. These observations
are consistent with the shadow of a Kerr black hole in general relativity (GR).
Observations of the shadow of SMBHs can be used to test modified gravity
theories, including Yukawa gravity, in extremely strong fields. In this paper,
we illustrate the shadows of Yukawa black holes, showing that their sizes are
significantly influenced by the Yukawa parameters $\lambda$ and $\kappa$. Using
the EHT observations of M87* and Sgr A*, we obtain constraints on the Yukawa
parameters. For Sgr A*, Keck and VLTI provide different priors on its
gravitational radius. The Sgr A* shadow yields $\kappa=-0.04^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$
for $\lambda>1$\,AU with the Keck prior, while $\kappa=-0.08^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$
with the VLTI prior. As $\lambda$ decreases, the constraints weaken, reaching
$-0.37<\kappa <0.17$ (Keck prior) and $-0.47<\kappa<0.04$ (VLTI prior) at
$\lambda=0.1$\,AU. For M87*, with a mass significantly larger than Sgr A*, this
system can only put constraints on $\kappa$ at larger $\lambda$. For
$\lambda>1.5\times10^4$\,AU, the \textit{EHT} observation of M87* yields
$\kappa=-0.01^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$. No significant deviation from GR is detected in
our analysis. Additionally, we explore potential constraints using the
next-generation VLBI, like \textit{ngEHT} and the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX),
which promise the detection of the second ring of photons. The improved angular
resolution and the measurements of the second ring could substantially refine
constraints on the Yukawa parameters, enhancing our ability to test deviations
from GR in the strong-field regime.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: CTA 1 is a shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) with a central pulsar wind
nebula (PWN), visible at very-high-energy (VHE) from 50 GeV to 100 TeV from a
moderately extended emission region. While general consensus concludes the VHE
emission originates from relativistic leptons accelerated by the PWN and
undergoing inverse Compton scattering, questions remain about electron escape
and propagation, as well as the evolutionary stage of this particular PWN. CTA
1 is on the cusp of middle age (~13 kyr) and spatially resolvable at energies
visible to imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), such as the Very
Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) (PSF < 0.1 deg).
Therefore, this remnant is an excellent candidate to study lepton propagation
and escape between different PWN evolutionary stages. Since the initial VERITAS
publication on CTA 1 in 2013, VERITAS has performed new observations, adding to
a total exposure of about 120 hours. We have analyzed the entire VERITAS CTA 1
dataset to date and report results.

Motivation: 通过模拟SMBHB合并的引力波信号，证明PTA在检测此类事件和参数估计方面的潜力。

Method: 模拟SMBHB合并的信号（包括并合、环形衰减和引力波记忆效应），研究其在PTA观测中的可检测性。

Result: 在观测条件下，PTA能够以约1度的天空位置不确定性探测到SMBHB合并信号，可能支持电磁波后续观测。

Conclusion: PTA在探测SMBHB合并和约束其参数方面具有可行性，并且测量不确定性对引力波背景的敏感度较低。

Abstract: Galaxy observations suggest there is about one merger of supermassive black
hole binaries (SMBHB) throughout the observable universe in a year. Here, we
introduce the methodology to search for gravitational waves from these events
with Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs).
  Modelling the inspiral, the merger, the ringdown, and the gravitational wave
memory components of the signal in simulated data, we demonstrate a proof of
principle for detection and parameter estimation. We study a few representative
SMBHB mergers with chirp masses spanning $10^{8} - 10^{10}~M_\odot$ at
distances from a few Mpc to 100~Mpc to asses their detectability in PTA
observations. Assuming the fixed binary inclination angle of $90^{\circ}$
corresponding to the maximum displacement memory signal, these signals appear
distinct for a PTA with 25 pulsars timed for 13 years with 100 ns precision.
  We demonstrate the capabilities of PTAs to constrain chirp masses and
distances of detected merging binaries, as well as to place limits. The sky
position uncertainties of the order of $1^{\circ}$, which we find in this
optimistic example, could potentially enable electromagnetic follow-up and
multi-messenger observations of SMBHB mergers. Finally, we show that the
measurement uncertainties on the parameters of simulated merging binaries
depend weakly on the presence of the gravitational wave background with
Hellings-Downs correlations in our simulated data.

Abstract: Jets in active galactic nuclei have to cross significant distances within
their host galaxies, meeting large numbers of stars of different masses and
evolution stages in their paths. Given enough time, supernova explosions within
the jet will eventually happen, and may have a strong impact on its dynamics,
potentially triggering powerful non-thermal activity. We carried out a detailed
numerical study to explore the dynamics of the interaction between the ejecta
of a supernova explosion and a relativistic extragalactic jet. By means of
relativistic hydrodynamics simulations using the code RATPENAT, we simulated
the jet-ejecta interaction in two different geometries or scenarios: a
two-dimensional, axisymmetric simulation, and a three-dimensional one, which
includes the orbital velocity of the exploding star. Although initially filling
a region much smaller than the jet radius, the ejecta expands and eventually
covers most of the jet cross section. The expansion is enhanced as more energy
from the jet is converted into kinetic and internal energy of the ejecta, which
also favors the ejecta disruption, all this occurring on timescales ~ 10^4 yr.
Although a complete numerical convergence of the results is unattainable given
the subsonic, turbulent nature of the interaction region, the simulations are
consistent in their description of the gross morphological and dynamical
properties of the interaction process. At the end of the simulations, the
supernova ejecta has already partially mixed with the relativistic jet. The
results also suggest that the jet-ejecta interaction may be a non-negligible
non-thermal emitter. Moreover, due to efficient mixing, the interaction region
can be a potential source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays of heavy
composition.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether cosmic-ray-induced acoustic instabilities can significantly confine charged particles near shocks, using simulations to validate growth rates and magnetic field perturbations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of cosmic-ray-induced instabilities in the acceleration and transport of cosmic rays, especially regarding their ability to confine particles near shocks to reach high energies like PeV.

Method: The authors used magnetohydrodynamical simulations to study the growth rates of acoustic instabilities and the resulting magnetic field perturbations caused by a cosmic-ray pressure gradient.

Result: The simulations showed a strong suppression of the diffusion coefficient for particles with Larmor radius about a thousandth of the precursor scale length.

Conclusion: The study suggests that acoustic instabilities induced by cosmic rays can significantly enhance self-confinement of charged particles near shocks, which may explain the efficient acceleration of cosmic rays to very high energies.

Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been growing observational and theoretical
evidence that cosmic-ray-induced instabilities play an important role in both
acceleration and transport of cosmic rays (CRs). For instance, the efficient
acceleration of charged particles at supernova remnant shocks requires rapidly
growing instabilities, so much so that none of the proposed processes seem
sufficient to warrant acceleration to PeV energies. In this work, we
investigate whether an acoustic instability triggered by the presence of a CR
pressure gradient can lead to significant self-confinement of charged particles
in the vicinity of shocks. We validate the expected growth rates and obtain the
scale and energy of magnetic field perturbations induced by such system using
magnetohydrodynamical simulations. Our results suggest a strong suppression of
the diffusion coefficient for particles with Larmor radius around a thousandth
of the precursor scale length.

TL;DR: 该研究利用低频射电数据提升脉冲星计时阵列（PTAs）对传播效应（如色散测量DM变化）的灵敏度，改进了对随机引力波背景（GWB）的探测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低频射电数据能更有效地检测脉冲星计时阵列中的传播效应，这对理解随机引力波背景至关重要，因此需要结合不同射电望远镜的数据以提升探测能力。

Method: 通过整合LOFAR（100-200 MHz）和NenuFAR（30-90 MHz）的观测数据与最新的欧洲和印度PTA数据集（DR2new+），构建了一个新的数据集DR2low，覆盖约11年的12颗脉冲星数据。采用Libstempo和Enterprise工具，并应用标准噪声模型（包括红噪声RN和时变DM（DMv）的幂律模型），同时使用贝叶斯模型选择方法，分析了RN、DMv和额外的色散噪声项（CN4）。

Result: DR2low数据集在DM约束和DM与RN贡献分离方面优于DR2new+。在12颗脉冲星中有10颗需要包含RN项，而DR2new+中仅有5颗。此外，在8颗脉冲星中检测到了显著的CN4噪声，而DR2new+中没有检测到。分析还发现了未建模的太阳风效应，特别是在太阳合日附近，残余延迟被吸收进DM项，显示了准确建模太阳风的重要性。

Conclusion: DR2low数据集显著提升了PTA对随机引力波背景的探测能力，提高了DM约束的精度，并揭示了新型噪声源和太阳风效应的影响，强调了低频观测在脉冲星计时研究中的价值。

Abstract: Low-frequency radio data improve the sensitivity of pulsar timing arrays
(PTAs) to propagation effects such as dispersion measure (DM) variations,
enabling better noise characterization essential for detecting the stochastic
gravitational wave background (GWB). We combined LOFAR (100-200 MHz) and
NenuFAR (30-90 MHz) observations with the recent European and Indian PTA
release (DR2new+) into a new dataset, DR2low, spanning ~11 years for 12
pulsars. DR2low allows updated noise models, increasing PTA sensitivity to the
GWB. Using Libstempo and Enterprise, we applied standard noise models including
red noise (RN) and time-variable DM (DMv) as power laws, and performed Bayesian
model selection over RN, DMv, and an additional chromatic noise term (CN4).
Compared to DR2new+, DR2low improves DM constraints and separates DM and RN
contributions. We found that the RN is required in the final model for 10 out
of 12 pulsars, compared to only 5 in the DR2new+ dataset. The improved
sensitivity to plasma effects provided by DR2low also favors the identification
of significant CN4 in eight pulsars, while none showed such evidence in
DR2new+. The analysis also reveals unmodelled solar wind effects, particularly
near solar conjunction, with residual delays absorbed into the DM component,
highlighting the importance of accurately modelling the solar wind in PTA
datasets.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究通过高分辨率的自适应粒子细化技术，发现潮汐撕裂事件中喷流冲击的能量耗散比例极低，因此认为这些冲击对TDE的演化影响不大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在恒星经过大质量黑洞引发潮汐撕裂事件后，其碎片在第二次过近日点时会形成喷流和扁饼状冲击，但以往的流体模拟中这些冲击的解析存在困难，导致结果不准确。

Method: 采用自适应粒子细化技术，对三维广义相对论的光滑粒子模拟进行局部高分辨率处理，达到$6.55	imes10^{11}$粒子的等效分辨率，从而准确解析冲击过程。

Result: 发现喷流冲击仅耗散$4	imes10^{-5}$的轨道能量，远低于传统估计，表明这些冲击在TDE演化中的作用有限。

Conclusion: 由于能量耗散极少，喷流冲击对TDE的演化影响不大，因此在模拟中可忽略其重要性。

Abstract: When debris from a star that experienced a tidal disruption events (TDE)
after passing too close to a massive black hole returns to pericenter on the
second passage, it is compressed, leading to the formation of nozzle shocks (in
the orbital plane) and pancake shocks (perpendicular to the orbital plane).
Resolving these shocks is a long-standing problem in the hydrodynamic
simulations of parabolic TDEs. Excessive numerical energy dissipation or
heating unrealistically expands the stream. In this Letter, we apply adaptive
particle refinement to our 3D general relativistic smoothed particle
simulations to locally increase the resolution near the pericenter. We achieve
resolutions equivalent to $6.55\times10^{11}$ particles, allowing us to
converge on the true energy dissipation. We conclude that only $4\times10^{-5}$
of the orbital energy is dissipated in nozzle shocks for a Sun-like star
tidally disrupted by a $10^6$ solar-mass black hole, therefore the nozzle
shocks are unlikely to be important in the evolution of TDEs.

Abstract: PKS 2155-304 is a well-known high-frequency peaked BL Lac (HBL) at redshift
z=0.116, which has been extensively studied across the electromagnetic spectrum
due to its rapid and large-amplitude variability. Several violent outbursts in
X-rays and $\gamma$-rays have been observed in the past, with intra-night
variability in very-high-energy $\gamma$-rays (VHE; E > 100 GeV) detected down
to the minute timescale. The alternation of quiescent and enhanced states,
observed with a tentative quasi-periodicity of 1.74 $\pm$ 0.13 years in
high-energy (HE; 100 MeV < E < 100 GeV) $\gamma$-rays, makes this source a key
target also for ground-based $\gamma$-ray instruments and in particular for the
Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. Its brightness, proximity, and
well-determined redshift make this $\gamma$-ray source a prime target for
fundamental physics studies, including tests of Lorentz Invariance Violation
(LIV), searches for axion-like particles (ALPs), and constraints on the
distribution of the extragalactic background light (EBL). In the last two
years, PKS 2155-304 has been independently monitored by the Major Atmospheric
Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes and the first Large-Sized
Telescope (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) located
at the Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain). The observations
were carried out at large zenith angles (LZA; ZA > 55{\deg}), and the VHE data
have been complemented with simultaneous observations in HE $\gamma$-rays
(Fermi-LAT), X-rays (Swift-XRT) and optical wavelengths (ASAS-SN).

Abstract: Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are prominent sources in the very-high energy
(VHE) gamma-ray sky, constituting the most numerous identified source class in
the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey (HGPS). They are comprised of energetic
particles originating from the pulsar and expanding into the surrounding
medium. As such, PWNe are of very high scientific interest as PeVatron
candidates, objects that could potentially accelerate particles up to PeV
energies. Additionally other aspects of their acceleration mechanism are being
actively investigated, such as the open question of whether they accelerate not
only leptonic but also hadronic particles, and the details of their morphology
and particle transport mechanism. As PWNe emit photons over a broad range of
the electromagnetic spectrum, multiwavelength (MWL) studies are crucial for the
investigation and study of their emission.
  In this vein we present a joint eROSITA X-ray and H.E.S.S. gamma-ray study of
the PWN MSH 15-52. We showcase our custom code for integrating the EDR and DR1
eROSITA data into the Gammapy framework, a python package optimised for the
analysis of gamma-ray data. We present the first 3D (spatial and spectral) fit
to eROSITA data by using Gammapy. We furthermore combine these data with the
public H.E.S.S. gamma-ray observations of MSH 15-52, resulting in a joint
physical fit of the underlying particle population, and a subsequent discussion
of the physical implications of our results. Finally we give an outlook towards
future efforts in MWL studies of PWNe and the broader context of MWL data
analysis with Gammapy.

Abstract: We developed the full magnetohydrodynamical analytical jet model that allows
accurate reproducing of a transversal and longitudinal structure for a highly
collimated relativistic jets. This model can be used as a setup for convenient
solution of radiative transfer equations and modelling the total intensity and
polarization maps. We show that the analytical fits are in excellent agreement
with the numerical solutions of full magnetohydrodynamical equations. Our
approach allows setting easily different models for an emitting plasma number
density. For example, we show that the equipartition number density ranges from
several to tens of percent of a total number density. We show that the
Doppler-corrected emissivity distribution behave in such a way that we may
expect a limb brightened intensity pattern on a sub-parsec scale and a
spine-brightened structure downstream. We reproduce the broken power-law
dependence of a jet pressure at its boundary from the jet radius. The
corresponding power exponents are in agreement with the parabola-to-cone
transition observed directly in nearby sources.

TL;DR: This paper studies systematic uncertainties in WIMP line emission searches using LST-1 telescope, focusing on instrument response functions, background rejection, and new simulation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dark Matter remains a mystery, and detecting gamma-ray emissions from WIMP annihilation could provide direct insights into electroweak-scale interactions, complementing other DM detection techniques.

Method: The paper analyzes the instrument response functions for large zenith angle observations, examines background rejection in monoscopic mode, and incorporates updated simulation results to assess systematic uncertainties in WIMP line emission searches.

Result: The study highlights effective methods for spectral line searches, emphasizing the potential of the LST-1 telescope's wide field of view and optimized gamma-ray detection at high energies.

Conclusion: The LST-1 telescope can significantly contribute to WIMP searches at the galactic center, with improved systematic understanding enhancing the reliability of future dark matter detection efforts.

Abstract: Dark Matter remains a great mystery in modern physics. Among various
candidates, the weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) scenario stands
out and is under extensive study. The detection of the hypothetical gamma-ray
emission from WIMP annihilation could act as a direct probe of
electroweak-scale interactions, complementing DM collider searches and other
direct DM detection techniques. At very high energies (VHE), WIMP
self-annihilation is expected to produce gamma rays together with other
Standard Model particles. The galactic center (GC), due to its relative
proximity to the Earth and its high expected DM density, is a prime target for
monoenergetic line searches. IACTs have placed strong constraints on the DM
properties at the GC, with the MAGIC providing the most stringent limits from
20 TeV to 100 TeV, exploiting large zenith angle (LZA) observations. However,
the limited field of view (FoV) of the MAGIC telescopes (< 3.5{\deg} )
prevented a detailed study of the extended region around the GC in which an
enhanced DM density is expected. The LST-1 of the CTAO, located at the Roque de
Los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain), close to the MAGIC site, has been
observing the GC since 2021. With its wide FoV of 4.5{\deg}, LST-1 could
contribute significantly to the WIMPs search at the GC. The observations are
performed at LZA (ZA > 58{\deg}), which, while required due to the source's low
altitude, also optimizes the detection of gamma rays up to 100 TeV and beyond.
We present a study of the systematic uncertainties in WIMP line emission
searches with LST-1. Our work examines the instrument response functions for
LZA observations, background rejection in monoscopic mode, and includes updated
results from simulations, highlighting new methods for spectral line searches.
