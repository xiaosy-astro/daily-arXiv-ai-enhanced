This reveals diverse progenitor histories for\nthese stellar explosions. This review paper summarizes various supernova\nsubtypes, linking them to stellar death pathways, and presents an updated\nsupernova classification diagram. We then present a multi-wavelength study of\ncircumstellar interaction in different supernova classes. We also present\nunpublished Chandra X-ray as well as radio observations of a type IIn\nsupernova, SN 2010jl, which allow us to extend its circumstellar interaction\nstudies to about 7 years post-explosion.

We assess the sensitivity of\nthe search using subthreshold gravitational-wave candidates from\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data, neutrino event candidates from public IceCube Neutrino\nObservatory data and AGN candidates from the Quaia catalog. A confident\ndetection of such an event would mark a breakthrough in multi-messenger\nastronomy."}

We model the spin evolution of the neutron\nstar (NS) by the accretion torque and the GW torque. We consider two mechanisms\nfor generating the non-axisymmetry responsible for the GW torque: i) magnetic\nmountains and ii) deformation after crustal breakage. Both torques are\nintertwined with the binary evolution, which we trace from the formation of the\nNS in a binary system with a main-sequence companion. We do this with MESA,\nstarting from a set of initial binary configurations. At current sensitivity, a\nmagnetic ellipticity of $\\varepsilon\\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ is necessary for\ndetection. The highest frequency at which we have detectable signals increases\nwith the accretion efficiency $\\eta$, and it can be as high as 360Hz. At 3G\n(Cosmic Explorer/Einstein telescope) sensitivity, less deformed Sco X-1 NSs,\nwith ellipticities as small as $6\\cdot 10^{-9}$, are detectable, but the\nwaveform highly depends on the binary system: the highest frequency of\ndetectable signals spans the very broad range 600-1700Hz, strongly depending on\n$\\eta$ and mass of the progenitor donor star $M^d$. If $\\eta\\leq$30%, the crust\ndoes not break. When $\\eta\\in$[40%,60%] only progenitors with\n$M^d\\geq[1.1,1.5]M_{\\odot}$ present crustal breakage, while if $\\eta\\geq$70%\nall crusts break. In some systems the crust breaks during their Sco X-1 phase.\nIf Sco X-1 were one of those systems, it would be emitting a very loud GW\nsignal sweeping from O(1000)Hz down to torque-balance frequencies. We estimate\ncurrent detection probability for this signal to be under 1%; this probability\nincreases substantially -- to around 41% -- with third-generation detectors."}

We develop a simple nuclear\nstar cluster model to evolve the rapid mass growth of black hole seeds into the\nsupermassive regime. The combined processes of tidal disruption events, black\nhole captures, and gas accretion are accounted for self-consistently in our\nmodel. Given the observed number density of Little Red Dots, and under\nreasonable assumptions, we predict at least a few tens of tidal disruption\nevents and at least a few black hole captures at $z=4$-$6$, with a tidal\ndisruption event rate an order of magnitude larger than the black hole capture\nrate. We also estimate the uncertainties in these estimates. Finally, we\ncomment on the low x-ray luminosity of Little Red Dots."}
