In both long-lived and short-lived remnant scenarios, neutrino flavor\nconversions modify species-dependent neutrino luminosities and mean energies,\nand drive the matter towards more neutron rich conditions. They produce up to\n$300\\%$ more neutron rich ejecta and significantly boost the r-process yields,\nespecially in low-density, near-equatorial outflows. We identify regions\nunstable to fast flavor instabilities and find that these instabilities persist\ndespite flavor conversions. We further test the sensitivity to the\nequilibration timescale of the flavor conversions, finding that slower flavor\nconversions can interact with thermodynamic equilibration, and increase the\nneutron richness of the ejecta. Flavor conversions may also contribute to\nstronger gravitational wave and neutrino emissions, pointing to a correlation\nbetween neutrino transport and merger dynamics. These results highlight the\npotential impact of flavor conversions while motivating future work to improve\non theoretical understanding of flavor instabilities in global simulations."}

Here we numerically study a BL in which the angular\nmomentum transport in the layer is accomplished via the excitation of global\nacoustic waves. While the earlier studies of such wave-mediated BLs typically\nmodeled the internal structure of the central object as a globally isothermal\nsphere with sharply rising density profile, here we explore the effect of other\ninternal density and temperature profiles on the mode operation. We model the\ninner structure of an accretor as a polytropic sphere, allowing a shallower\nincrease of density and a non-trivial temperature profile inside the object.\nWhile the mix of acoustic modes observed in our long-duration (1000 inner\norbits long) 2D hydrodynamic simulations is a weak function of the polytropic\nindex $n$ of the accretor's structure, the mass accretion rate and the angular\nmomentum flux across the BL show a clear dependence on $n$, both decreasing in\namplitude as $n$ is lowered. Interestingly, in 2D these transport metrics are\nbetter correlated not with $n$ but with a total mass inside the central object\ncontained within the simulation domain. These results improve our understanding\nof the wave-mediated BL accretion by quantifying the effect of the inner\nstructure of the accretor on the excitation and propagation of acoustic modes\nmediating the BL transport."}

We present a systematic study of the sensitivity of XRB models to\nuncertainties in charged-particle-induced reaction rates across a broad\nparameter space of accretion rates and fuel compositions in low-mass X-ray\nbinaries. The study proceeds in two stages: ignition conditions are first\ndetermined with a semi-analytic framework coupled to a full reaction network,\nfollowed by a sensitivity analysis using the ONEZONE model with individual rate\nvariations. We identify 41 reactions that alter the burst light curve and 187\nthat significantly impact final abundances.

A large, 28 m diameter telescope is used in monoscopic mode to access\nthe lowest energies ($E \\gtrsim 30$ GeV), while the four smaller, 12 m diameter\ntelescopes are used in stereoscopic mode to study energies between 150 GeV and\n100 TeV. Nevertheless, a combination of both telescope types and trigger\nstrategies has proven to be challenging. In this work, we propose for the first\ntime an analysis based on event types capable of exploiting both telescope\ntypes, trigger strategies, and the whole energy range of the experiment. Due to\nthe large differences between monoscopic and stereoscopic reconstructions, the\ntypes are defined based on Hillas parameters of individual events, resulting in\nthree types (Type M, Type B, and Type A), each dominating over a different\nenergy range. The performances of the new analysis configurations are compared\nto the standard configurations in the H.E.S.S. Analysis Package (HAP), Mono and\nStereo. The proposed analysis provides optimal sensitivity over the whole\nenergy range, in contrast to Mono and Stereo, which focus on smaller energy\nranges. On top of that, improvements in sensitivity of 25-45% are found for\nmost of the energy range. The analysis is validated using real data from the\nCrab Nebula, showing the application to data of an IACT analysis capable of\ncombining significantly different telescope types with significantly different\nenergy ranges. Larger energy coverage, lower energy threshold, smaller\nstatistical uncertainty, and more robustness are observed.

Searches for gravitational-wave lensing by the\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration have begun. One common method focuses on\nstrong gravitational-wave lensing, which produces multiple \"images\": repeated\ncopies of the same gravitational wave that differ only in amplitude, arrival\ntime, and overall \"Morse phase.\" The literature identifies two separate\napproaches to identifying such repeated gravitational-wave events based on\nfrequentist and Bayesian approaches.

Here, we discuss these problems, unify the different\napproaches in Bayesian language, and derive the posterior odds for strong\nlensing. In particular, the Bayes factor and prior odds are sensitive to the\nnumber of gravitational-wave events in the data, but the posterior odds are\ninsensitive to it once strong lensing time delays are accounted for. We confirm\nLo et al.'s (2020) finding that selection effects enter the Bayes factor as an\noverall normalisation constant.
