Our high-resolution image discovers new small-scale features in the nebula, including an elliptical core of $40''\\times20''$ surrounding the central pulsar and a $2'$-long arc wrapping around the core in the north. The latter shows a clear gap from the core, and it consists of a bright lobe in the northwest and a tongue-like structure in the northeast. These could be resulting from the pulsar wind interaction with the environment. Our polarization measurement reveals a highly ordered magnetic field with toroidal geometry. The small scale features are all highly linearly polarized. In particular, the lobe has a polarization fraction of $\\sim$60%, close to the synchrotron limit. This is also much higher than the value measured at a lower frequency, implying significant depolarization. We show that this can be explained by Faraday rotation in the nebula, and we constructed a simple 3D model accordingly to infer a magnetic field strength of $\\sim$50-105$μ$G."}

The origin of these isolated objects therefore remains an open problem. In this Letter, we propose a physically motivated encounter rate per binary, $Λ\\propto n a/(σa_H)$, incorporating the local stellar density $n$, velocity dispersion $σ$, binary separation $a$, and the Heggie--Hills ionization radius $a_H$. Combined with companion ablation by the MSP, this rate successfully predicts the observed fraction of isolated MSPs in GCs, that is $\\mathcal{F}_i \\proptoΛ\\propto a_H^{-1}$, establishing dynamical ionization as the primary channel for producing isolated MSPs. We quantitatively test this model against a null hypothesis in which $\\mathcal{F}_i$ is independent of $a_H$, and find that the ionization-driven model is 220 times more likely than the null hypothesis. Our framework naturally explains the observed overabundance of isolated MSPs in $ω$ Centauri and establishes binary ionization as the primary mechanism responsible for the production of isolated MSPs in GCs."}

This, in turn, could mean that the dark matter halo also shares these properties. In this work, by fitting to the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations, we test the compatibility of the morphology of the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) from dark matter annihilation with a triaxial dark matter halo. In particular, we consider both untilted triaxial halos and halos whose principal axes are tilted with respect to the Galactic disk. In our fits of the Fermi-LAT data, by testing over a large library of galactic diffuse emission models, we quantify how the halo triaxiality and tilt affect the line-of-sight-integrated annihilation signal and, consequently, the preferred GCE spatial templates. We find that the GCE spectrum and inner cuspiness are robust against variations in the triaxiality and tilt of the dark matter halo. However, in terms of its overall morphology, the GCE in the gamma-ray data can discriminate between choices for the dark matter halo's triaxiality and tilt. Finally, we find that the GCE is more compatible with originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of dark matter than originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of stars, a result important for understanding the GCE's origin."}

Such fluids can be often described by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In this review, we mainly consider MHD turbulence with a strong mean magnetic field whose energy density is greater than or equal to the local kinetic energy density. In these fluids, the MHD waves, especially Alfvén waves, play a dominant dynamical role. Alfvén waves travel along magnetic field lines and collisions of opposite-traveling Alfvén wave packets are essential for turbulence cascade. We focus on strong turbulence regime, where nonlinear interaction during the collision is sufficiently strong and thus one collision is enough to complete turbulence cascade. We will cover the following types of turbulence. First, we review strong Alfvénic MHD turbulence. If the mean magnetic field is very strong, wave packets move very fast and duration of collision is too short to complete turbulence cascade. Even in this case we will show that strong turbulence regime emerges on a small scale. Second, we will consider small-scale MHD turbulence, where interaction of small-scale variants of Alfvén waves (i.e., whistler waves) is important. Third, we review scaling relations in strong relativistic force-free MHD turbulence, where interaction of relativistic Alfvén waves is important. Finally, we briefly discuss scaling relations in compressible MHD turbulence, where interaction of Alfvén waves is still important."}

Although discovered in this context, there is no evidence that the transient is associated with any known gravitational wave event. Nonetheless, this source exhibits a 20-fold increase in flux density over $<250$ days, and it remains in a declining, detectable state more than 1000 days after the initial detection. Follow-up observations from 0.3 to 9 GHz reveal an evolving spectrum consistent with synchrotron emission. ASKAP J0055-2558 is spatially coincident with a low-mass, star-forming galaxy at redshift $z = 0.116$ ($d_{\\rm L}$= 543 Mpc), placing its peak radio luminosity at $νL_ν\\sim 10^{39}\\,\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$. Analysis of its radio light curve, inferred blastwave velocity, energetics, host galaxy properties and the absence of counterparts at other wavelengths suggest that ASKAP J0055-2558 is most consistent with either the late-time phase of an orphan long gamma-ray burst afterglow or a tidal disruption event involving an intermediate-mass black hole spatially offset from the galaxy nucleus. The radio discovery of either of these phenomena is extremely rare, with only a few or no confirmed examples to date."}

Astrophys. (A&A) Letters, 700, L22 (2025). 6 pages, 3 figures. Published online: 20 Aug 2025", "summary": "Context. Compact jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN) are commonly assumed to be in equipartition between particle and magnetic-field energy densities at the regions where the radio emission dominates at centimetre wavelengths. This assumption has significant implications for both jet physics and the accuracy of VLBI-based astrometry and geodesy.\n  Aims. We tested the validity of the energy equipartition hypothesis in AGN cores at centimetre wavelengths by analysing the blazar 1803+784 using simultaneous broadband full-polarization observations with the VLBI Global Observing System (VGOS).\n  Methods. We present VGOS observations of the blazar 1803+784 covering the 3-11 GHz frequency range. The data were processed using a dedicated calibration pipeline, followed by model fitting and multi-frequency imaging analysis. We measured the frequency-dependent core shift and mapped the spectral index and rotation measure (RM) across the source.\n  Results. We find a core-shift power-law index of $k_r = 0.73^{+0.12}_{-0.19}$, significantly deviating from the expected equipartition value of $k_r = 1$. This indicates that either the equipartition condition or the conical jet geometry, or both, are not fulfilled in the centimetre-wavelength core region. The wide frequency coverage of VGOS also allows us to decouple the Faraday rotation of the core into an internal component (${\\rm RM}_I = 121 \\pm 8$ rad m$^{-2}$, produced in the core region) and an external component (${\\rm RM}_E = -44 \\pm 9$ rad m$^{-2}$, associated with a distant, extended medium that may also affect the polarization in downstream regions of the jet at larger scales).\n  Conclusions. These results demonstrate the power of VGOS for high-fidelity simultaneous multi-frequency polarimetric studies of compact AGN jets, and underline the need to account for non-equipartition effects in both jet astrophysics and geodetic VLBI."}

We can confidently point radio telescopes to the positions of Fermi unidentified gamma-ray sources that have a high probability of hosting a pulsar. As part of Transients and Pulsars with MeerKAT (TRAPUM), we conducted a survey of Fermi-LAT sources using the Ultra High Frequency (UHF; 544-1088 MHz) receiver of the MeerKAT radio telescope. We observed 79 sources that were identified as pulsar-like candidates using a random forest technique from the Fermi-LAT Fourth Source Catalogue. We observed each target for 10 minutes at two separate epochs. As a result, we discovered nine new millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and six slow pulsars. Based on the radio discoveries, we also searched for gamma-ray pulsations, confirming that seven of the newly discovered MSPs are associated with Fermi-LAT sources, and performed joint radio and gamma-ray pulsar timing. Companion mass estimates and evidence of radio eclipses indicate that among the nine MSPs there are three black widows and three redbacks. Lastly, we compared the discovered pulsars in the MeerKAT UHF survey against the previous Fermi sources TRAPUM survey at L band, concluding the superiority of UHF observations in sensitivity to fainter pulsars and in detection rate than L band for finding new gamma-ray MSPs."}
