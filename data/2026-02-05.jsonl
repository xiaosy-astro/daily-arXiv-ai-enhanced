This paper -- the second in a series -- documents capabilities for Newtonian self-gravitating fluid dynamics, including tabulated microphysical equations of state treating nuclei and nuclear matter (`baryonic matter'). Computation of the gravitational potential of a spheroid, and simulation of the gravitational collapse of dust and of an ideal fluid, provide tests of self-gravitation against known solutions. In multidimensional computations of the adiabatic collapse, bounce, and explosion of spherically symmetric pre-supernova progenitors -- which we propose become a standard benchmark for code comparisons -- we find that the explosions are prompt and remain spherically symmetric (as expected), with an average shock expansion speed and total kinetic energy that are inversely correlated with the progenitor mass at the onset of collapse and the compactness parameter."}

Hypothesize is the existence of isolated antimatter domains in a baryon-asymmetric Universe that survive until the era of first star formation ($Z \\approx 20$). By assuming CPT-symmetry, the thermodynamics, mechanics, and energy dynamics of an antimatter gas cloud (composed of antihydrogen and antihelium) are treated symmetrically to their primordial matter counterparts. Analysis demonstrates the physical feasibility of the gravitational collapse process for a conservatively estimated antimatter domain ($\\approx 5 \\times 10^3 M_{\\odot}$). The initial conditions easily satisfy the Jeans and Bonnor-Ebert mass criteria, indicating a high propensity for instability and runaway collapse. The subsequent dynamical evolution, driven by $\\bar{H}_2$ cooling, is predicted to proceed identically to that of Population III star formation, leading to the formation of a dense, adiabatic anti-protostellar core. The theoretical viability of a true antistar hinges upon a critical assumption: the physical possibility of antinuclear fusion (e.g., the antiproton cycle) under extreme core conditions. Assuming this symmetry holds, the collapse is predicted to yield massive antistars ($\\gtrsim 22 M_{\\odot}$). This suggests that if antimatter domains formed in the early Universe, they likely underwent stellar formation. Observational constraints on the existence of these objects must rely on the detection of characteristic high-energy $γ$-ray or X-ray signals resulting from matter-antimatter annihilation at the domain boundaries or during mass accretion."}

In this work we analyze both contributions to the GW signal for two state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3D) SN models computed with the Prometheus-Vertex neutrino-hydrodynamics code. In contrast to the far majority of models analyzed for GWs so far, our core-collapse simulations were started with 12.28 M_sun (18.88 M_sun) progenitors, whose final hour (7 min) of convective oxygen-shell burning was computed in 3D and featured a vigorous oxygen-neon shell merger. The corresponding large-scale asymmetries in the oxygen layer are conducive to buoyancy-aided neutrino-driven explosions. The models were continuously evolved in 3D from the pre-collapse evolution until 5.11 s (1.68 s) after the core bounce. The GW signals result from the well-known dynamical phenomena in the SN core such as prompt postshock convection, neutrino-driven convection, the standing accretion shock instability, proto-neutron star oscillations, and anisotropic ejecta expansion. They do not exhibit any new or specific features that can be unambiguously connected to the powerful pre-collapse activity in the progenitors, but we identify interesting differences compared to results in the literature. We also discuss measurement prospects by interferometers, confirming that GW signals from future Galactic SNe will be detectable with existing and next-generation experiments working in the frequency range f ~ 1-2000 Hz."}

A promising model for QPEs is the star-disc collisions model, where a star repeatedly interacts with an accretion disc around a black hole, creating shocks that expel dense outflows of gas from which radiation emerges. We investigate the dynamics of the star-disc collisions, the properties of the outflows, and the resulting radiation signatures. Our study focuses on the generic case where the star remains unperturbed by the collision and the stellar crossing time through the disc is sufficiently long for shocked gas to flow around the star. We performed a three-dimensional (3D) radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of the star-disc collision. The star was modeled as a solid, spherical body, and the interaction was simulated for a small, local section of the accretion disc. We found that star-disc collisions generate a nearly paraboloidal bow shock. The heating of gas is not confined to the column of gas directly ahead of the star but also extends laterally as the shock front expands sideways while traveling with the star. As the star crosses the disc, it injects momentum preferentially along its direction of motion, leading to an asymmetric redistribution of energy and momentum. As a result, two outflows emerge on opposite sides of the disc with different properties: the forward outflow expands faster, contains more mass, carries more energy, and is about twice as luminous as the backward outflow. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry in outflow properties and luminosity arises naturally from the collision dynamics, offering a possible explanation for the alternating strong-weak flare patterns observed in several QPE sources."}

SN 2024aecx is a peculiar SN Ic that exhibited luminous shock-cooling emission at early times, suggestive of close-in circumstellar medium (CSM), unexpected for this class of SNe. Its early NIR spectra are typical for a SN Ic but with strong CI absorption features. By ~32 days post peak, the spectra show a strong NIR excess, while maintaining normal optical colors, unprecedented for SNe Ic. We find that the NIR excess is well fit with a single-temperature, optically thin dust model with declining temperature, increasing mass, and roughly constant luminosity over time. The NIR excess appears too promptly for dust to have formed in the SN ejecta, indicating an IR echo from pre-existing dust in the CSM. The IR echo is likely powered by the relatively slowly evolving SN peak light, and not the brief shock cooling emission, as the latter requires unrealistically high CSM densities to explain the observed dust mass. We consider different potential CSM geometries and find that a thick face-on disk with an inner edge around $5\\times 10^{16}$ cm can best explain the dust mass and temperature evolution. In this scenario, the SN shock should start interacting with this CSM $440\\pm200$ days post explosion. CSM around SN Ic is rare, and follow-up observations of SN 2024aecx will probe the mass-loss process responsible for removing hydrogen and helium from their progenitor star."}

Submitted for publication to A&A", "summary": "Observed cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) in X-ray pulsars (XRPs) exhibit strong variability. In the subcritical luminosity regime, the centroid energy ($E_{CRSF}$) and line width ($σ_{CRSF}$) often show positive correlations with the X-ray luminosity. We investigate the physical origin of the observed variability quantitatively, focusing on the effects of resonant scattering and Doppler shift induced by the plasma flow in the accretion funnel. We developed a relativistic Monte Carlo code to perform detailed radiative transfer calculations in the accretion funnel above the hotspot and derive angle-dependent spectra. Analytical plasma density and velocity profiles were adopted to account for the effects of radiation pressure on the flow. Approximate resonant scattering cross-sections were employed. We varied the accretion luminosity to explore the resulting variability of the CRSF properties. The emergent spectra exhibit a prominent, asymmetric CRSF accompanied by a broad blue wing. The CRSF is systematically redshifted relative to the classical cyclotron energy, with the magnitude of the redshift decreasing at higher luminosities and for larger viewing angles $θ$. Both $E_{CRSF}$ and $σ_{CRSF}$ correlate positively with luminosity for all viewing angles. Their absolute values, however, depend strongly on the viewing angle, indicating substantial variability over the pulse cycle and sensitivity to the system geometry. At fixed luminosity, $E_{CRSF}$ ($σ_{CRSF}$) decreases (increases) with increasing $\\cosθ$. Consequently, phase-resolved observations are expected to reveal an anticorrelation between the CRSF centroid energy and width. When applied to the XRP GX 304$-$1, the model reproduces the observed CRSF variability over nearly an order of magnitude in luminosity for geometries in which the accretion funnel is predominantly viewed edge-on."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Massive stars have been proposed as candidates to be major factories of Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). However, this claim lacks enough empirical evidence, especially for isolated stars. The powerful stellar winds from massive stars impact the ambient medium producing strong shocks suitable for accelerating relativistic particles. The detection of non-thermal emission-particularly synchrotron emission in low radio frequencies-serves as a key proof of particle acceleration sites. We aim to assess the potential of isolated massive stars as sources of GCRs. We observed the Wolf-Rayet bubble, NGC 2359, using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at Band 3 (250-500 MHz) and Band 4 (550-950 MHz). Additionally, we used complementary archival radio datasets at different frequencies to derive the broad spectral energy distribution (SED) for several regions within the bubble. To further characterize the interaction between the stellar wind and the ambient medium, we introduced a composite SED model including synchrotron and free-free emission, and two low-frequency turnover processes, the Razin-Tsytovich (RT) effect and free-free absorption (FFA).We used a Bayesian inference approach to fit the SEDs and constrain the electron number density and magnetic field strength. The SEDs of several regions reveal spectral indices steeper than -0.5, indicative of synchrotron emission. and show a turnover below ~1 GHz. Our SED modelling suggests that the observed turnover is primarily caused by the RT effect, with a minor contribution from internal FFA. Our analysis confirms the presence of synchrotron radiation within NGC 2359. This is the second detection of non-thermal emission in a stellar bubble surrounding a WR star, reinforcing the idea that such environments are sites of relativistic particle acceleration and supporting the hypothesis that isolated massive stars are sources of GCRs of at least GeV energies."}

We selected a sample of 26 bright GRBs with measured redshifts $z<1$ observed by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift) and simulated what BAT would have observed if the GRBs were at larger redshifts. We measured the durations of the simulated gamma-ray signals using a Bayesian block approach and calculated the enclosed fluences and peak fluxes. As expected, we found that almost all durations (fluences) measured for simulated high-$z$ GRBs were shorter (less) than their true durations (energies) due to low signal-to-noise ratio emission becoming completely dominated by background, i.e., the ``tip-of-the-iceberg'' effect. This effect strongly depends on the profile and intensity of the source light curve. Due to the uniqueness of GRB light curves, there is no common behavior in the evolution of measured durations with redshift. We compared our synthetic high-$z$ (i.e., $z>3$) GRBs to a sample of 72 observed high-$z$ bursts and found that the two samples were not inconsistent with being drawn from the same underlying population. We conclude that: (i) prompt emission durations (fluences) of high-$z$ GRBs observed by Swift/BAT are most likely underestimations, sometimes by factors of $\\sim$several tens ($\\sim2$), and (ii) changes in the average GRB prompt emission duration and fluence with increasing redshift are consistent with the tip-of-the-iceberg effect."}

Notably, both anti-glitches were observed in 4U 0142+61, making it the most frequent source of such events, and there is a hint of regular evolution in its pulse profile. In the case of 1RXS J170849.0-400910, it continues to exhibit pronounced high-frequency timing anomalies and undergoes a state transition event.

In recent years, the SMT channel has received significant attention due to detailed binary models showing increased mass transfer stability compared to previous studies. In this work, we perform a full zero-age-main-sequence to compact object merger analysis using detailed binary models at eight metallicities between $10^{-4}Z_\\odot$ and $2Z_\\odot$ to self-consistently model the population properties of BBH mergers in the SMT channel, determined their progenitor initial conditional, and investigate the binary physics governing their formation and metallicity dependence.

Using its extended grids of MESA binary models, we determine the essential physics in the formation of BBH mergers. SMT produces BBH mergers predominantly from systems with $P_{ZAMS}\\leq10$ days. In these systems, both the initial mass transfer between two stars and the subsequent interaction between the remaining star and the first-born BH take place while the respective donor star is on the main-sequence (Case A). We find a limited contribution from wider Case B/C systems. Without a natal kick, the SMT channel does not produce BBH mergers above $Z>0.2Z_\\odot$ due to orbital widening from stellar wind mass loss. The primary BH mass distribution shows a strong dependence on metallicity, while the mass ratio prefers unity independent of metallicity due to mass ratio reversal. Additionally, the $χ_{eff}$ distributions contain peaks at $χ_{eff}=0$ and ~0.15 of which the former disappears at high metallicities. A mass-scaled natal kick leave this sub-population unchanged but introduce a low-mass, unequal mass ratio sub-population that merges due to their high eccentricity."}
