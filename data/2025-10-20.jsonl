Comment Welcome", "summary": "We investigate magnetic-field amplification driven by the nonresonant hybrid\n(NRH or Bell) instability and its impact on cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration at\nreverse shocks of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) from active galactic nuclei (AGN).\nPrevious kinetic studies by particle-in-cell simulations have demonstrated that\nwhen maximum CR energy is near the injection scale, NRH instability efficiently\namplifies magnetic field up to the saturation level. However, the efficiency of\nNRH instability goes down as maximum energy increase since CR current is\ncarried by escaping CRs near the maximum energy. We employ a one-dimensional\nMHD--CR framework solving telegraph-type diffusion--convection equations to\ntrace the coupled evolution of CRs, magnetic fields, and shock dynamics under\nrealistic parameters. We find a distinct transition with magnetic field\nstrength: for weak background fields ($B_{0}\\!\\lesssim\\!10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{G}$),\nNRH instability efficiently amplifies upstream turbulence, driving a\nself-regulated state where $E_{\\max}$ becomes independent of initial strength\nof magnetic turbulence. In contrast, for stronger background fields\n($B_{0}\\!\\gtrsim\\!10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{G}$), the escaping CR current is too weak to\ndrive NRH instability, and magnetic turbulence further decays through\nparametric instabilities, potentially reducing the acceleration efficiency.

It is also\ncrucial to avoid numerical artifacts due to the polar coordinate axis\nsingularity. Methods that behave well near the axis often break\nflux-conservative form of the hydrodynamic equations, resulting in significant\ndrifts in conserved quantities.
