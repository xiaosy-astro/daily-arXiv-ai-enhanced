Abstract: We present the equation of state for two classes of new ultralight particles,
a scalar field coupling to electrons and a light $\mathbb{Z}_\mathcal{N}$ QCD
axion field coupling to nucleons. Both are potential candidates for dark
matter. Using the scalar modified equations of state, we calculate models for
white dwarf stars and compare their radii and masses with observed mass-radius
data. The comparison results in stringent constraints on the masses of the
particles and the coupling parameters. For a wide range of particle masses and
coupling parameters, constraints from the white dwarf equation of state surpass
existing limits, outperforming also dedicated laboratory searches. The
remarkable accuracy of modern white-dwarf mass-radius relation data,
exemplified by Sirius B, now allows stringent tests of dense-matter physics and
constraints on new particle scenarios.

### [2] [Are all Binary Black Holes Detected from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Follow the Universal Time-Delay Distributions? Likely Not](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06352)
*Samsuzzaman Afroz,Navdha,Suvodip Mukherjee*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 该研究利用非参数方法重构了双黑洞合并延迟时间分布（DTD），首次发现质量依赖的演化路径，低质量系统符合尺度不变的DTD，而高质量系统显示出偏离简单幂律的特征，偏好在2-6十亿年快速合并。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更准确地理解双黑洞合并的演化历史和引力波（GW）发射之间的联系，研究者们需要摆脱仅限于幂律形式的限制性假设。

Method: 该研究采用非参数重构方法，分析来自GWTC-4的双黑洞（BBH）数据，避免了使用参数化形式的假设，从而能够更灵活地捕捉质量依赖的DTD特征。

Result: 分析结果显示，低质量系统（20-40个太阳质量）的DTD符合尺度不变性，而高质量系统（40-100个太阳质量）的DTD首次显示出偏离简单幂律的趋势，表现出对2-6十亿年快速合并的显著偏好。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了非参数方法在重构质量依赖DTD方面的优势，首次揭示了高质量引力波事件可能与特定时间尺度相关的潜力。

Abstract: The delay time distribution (DTD) of binary black hole (BBH) mergers encodes
the evolutionary link between the formation history and gravitational-wave (GW)
emission. We present a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass-dependent DTD
using the BBHs from the GWTC-4 that avoids restrictive assumptions of only
power-law forms. Our analysis reveals for the first time the signature for
mass-dependent evolutionary pathways: lower-mass systems ($20$-$40\,M_\odot$)
are consistent with a scale-invariant DTD, whereas higher-mass BBHs
($40$-$100\,M_\odot$) provide the first direct tentative evidence of DTD that
deviate from simple power laws, with a pronounced preference for rapid mergers
around $2-6$ Gyrs. These findings reveal the advantage of the non-parametric
technique in reconstructing the mass-dependent DTD and discovering for the
first-time the presence of a potential time-scale associated with high-mass GW
events.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We report on new Chandra ACIS-I observations of the X-ray knots located in
the western and eastern lobes of W50 associated with the parsec-scale jets of
the Galactic microquasar SS 433. These knots are likely counterparts of the
recently detected very-high-energy ($E>100$ GeV) gamma-ray emission by HAWC and
H.E.S.S. These findings, together with the ultra-high-energy signal recently
reported by the LHAASO collaboration, have established the SS 433/W50 system as
a unique jet-driven PeVatron candidate. Combining new and archival Chandra
data, we perform the first proper motion search of the X-ray knot structures
over a time interval spanning approximately 20 years. We found no statistically
significant motion of these knots at the 3$\sigma$ confidence level, and place
an upper limit of $<$ 0.019-0.033$c$ (5,800-9,800 km s$^{-1}$) for the speed of
the innermost knots at an assumed distance $d=5.5$ kpc. Combined with the
velocities reported in the literature, the upstream speed in the shock rest
frame would reach several 10$^4$ km s$^{-1}$, suggesting that highly efficient
particle acceleration, approaching the Bohm limit, is occurring. The absence of
significant motion of the knots suggests the presence of a standing
recollimation shock, formed by the balance between the jet pressure and the
external pressure. This interpretation is consistent with the expected
occurrence of such shocks at 20-30 pc from SS 433, matching the location of the
observed knots.

### [4] [Dual perspectives on GX 17+2: a simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06614)

TL;DR: 该研究首次同时使用NICER和NuSTAR对GX 17+2进行了光谱和时变分析，发现其盘在不同分支的位置变化，并表明变化的起源可能来自盘/边界层而非致密层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更深入地理解Sco-like Z源GX 17+2在色-光度图（HID）上的演化过程，以及其光谱和时变特性如何与吸积盘的结构变化相关联。

Method: 利用NICER和NuSTAR同时观测GX 17+2，并采用反射模型框架分析其宽带光谱，结合时变分析方法研究其变化特性。

Result: 发现吸积盘在水平分支（HB）位置较远（约4 R_ISCO），并向内移动至尖峰分支（FB），FB是盘接近中子星的最近点；时变分析显示，从正常分支（NB）至软尖峰（SA）时，RMS变化增加，随后在FB保持恒定，表明变化可能源自盘/边界层。

Conclusion: GX 17+2的演化过程反映了相对较短的盘在水平分支的位置变化，随着其沿HID向正常分支、软尖峰和最终尖峰分支移动而向中子星靠拢。变化的起源可能与盘/边界层的不稳定性有关，而非致密层。

Abstract: We performed the first simultaneous NICER & NuSTAR spectral and timing study
of the Sco-like Z source GX 17+2. The source traced the full Z track during
four observations. We detect signatures of relativistic reflection in the
broadband spectra and report results using a reflection framework. The disk is
relatively close to the innermost stable circular orbit ($\sim$ 1-4
R$_{ISCO}$), which agrees with previous studies of GX 17+2, but the location of
the inner disk is farther out in the horizontal branch (HB) and moves inward
toward the flaring branch (FB). We find the FB to be the point of closest
approach of the disk to the neutron star. We qualitatively conclude that the
evolution of the source along the HID is that of a relatively truncated disk in
the HB ($\sim$ 4 R$_{ISCO}$) that approaches the neutron star as it goes along
the HID towards the normal branch (NB), soft apex (SA), and finally the FB. We
attribute the source evolution along the Z track to varying mass accretion rate
and disk instabilities. Rms variability increases from the NB towards the SA
and then drops to a constant along the FB indicating that the observed
variability likely originates from the disk/boundary layer rather than the
corona.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: IC 10 X-1, NGC 300 X-1, and Cyg X-3 represent a unique class of X-ray
binaries consisting of a stellar-mass black hole (BH) accreting material from a
Wolf-Rayet (WR) star companion. These systems are particularly intriguing due
to their short orbital periods (less than 1.5 d), making them promising
progenitors of gravitational wave (GW) sources detectable by the
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. With a newly implemented prescription for
accretion efficiency in the standard Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) framework and
a corrected treatment of dynamical tides, we present for the \textit{first}
time detailed binary evolution models to diagnose their properties at different
evolutionary states and evaluate their fates as potential GW sources detectable
by the LVK network. With additional constraints on the observed properties of
IC 10 X-1 and NGC 300 X-1, we determine that the upper limit of the BH mass in
these systems (IC 10 X-1: $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 25\, M_\odot$, NGC 300 X-1:
$M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 15\, M_\odot$) is much lower than previously estimated.
Both systems are expected to form binary black holes (BBHs) that will merge
within a Hubble time, unless the BH in NGC 300 X-1 has a mass of $9\,M_\odot$,
the lower limit estimated in a previous study based on the continuum-fitting
method employing a relativistic slim-disc model. For Cyg X-3, we find that the
upper limit on the BH spin magnitude cannot exceed 0.6. Interestingly, the WR
star in Cyg X-3 is likely to form a lower-mass gap BH, and the resulting binary
BH system will merge within the Hubble time.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The 136 year long optical light curve of OJ~287 is explained by a binary
black hole model where the secondary is in a 12 year orbit around the primary.
Impacts of the secondary on the accretion disk of the primary generate a series
of optical flares which follow a quasi-Keplerian relativistic mathematical
model. The orientation of the binary in space is determined from the behavior
of the primary jet. Here we ask how the jet of the secondary black hole
projects onto the sky plane. Assuming that the jet is initially perpendicular
to the disk, and that it is ballistic, we follow its evolution after the
Lorentz transformation to the observer's frame. Since the orbital speed of the
secondary is of the order of one-tenth of the speed of light, the result is a
change in the jet direction by more than a radian during an orbital cycle. We
match the theoretical jet line with the recent 12 $\mu$as-resolution
RadioAstron map of OJ~287, and determine the only free parameter of the
problem, the apparent speed of the jet relative to speed of light. It turns out
that the Doppler factor of the jet, $\delta\sim5$, is much lower than in the
primary jet. Besides following a unique shape of the jet path, the secondary
jet is also distinguished by a different spectral shape than in the primary
jet. The present result on the spectral shape agrees with the huge optical
flare of 2021 November 12, also arising from the secondary jet.

TL;DR: 研究发现了一个位于银河系平面下方17.5度的巨型超高能伽马射线发射体，其形状类似巨型‘花生’，与一个高度年老的毫秒脉冲星MSP J0218+4232位置一致，挑战了现有模型，表明毫秒脉冲星可能加速粒子到PeV能量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于观测到的超高能伽马射线（UHE {	extgamma}-rays）源数量增加，需要了解其加速机制、特定源类的相对贡献以及粒子运输在形成观测到的发射中的作用。

Method: 利用LHAASO（大型高海拔空气 shower 观测站）的观测数据，识别并分析了位于-17.5{	extdegree}处的异常伽马射线发射体的不对称形状，确定与之位置一致的毫秒脉冲星MSP J0218+4232作为可能的加速源。

Result: 该巨型发射体的伽马射线能谱延伸到0.7 PeV，如果确认，将是首个由毫秒脉冲星驱动的PeV粒子加速器的证据，挑战了现有理论模型。

Conclusion: 这一发现表明毫秒脉冲星可能具备加速粒子到PeV能量的能力，揭示了超高能天体物理学领域中对粒子加速、宇宙射线运输和星际磁场效应的根本性理解缺陷，并可能揭示新的PeV加速器类别。

Abstract: Ultra-high-energy (UHE), exceeding 100 TeV (10^12 electronvolts),
{\gamma}-rays manifests extreme particle acceleration in astrophysical sources.
Recent observations by {\gamma}-ray telescopes, particularly by the Large High
Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), have revealed a few tens of UHE
sources, indicating numerous Galactic sources capable of accelerating particles
to PeV (10^15 electronvolts) energies. However, discerning the dominant
acceleration mechanisms (leptonic versus hadronic), the relative contributions
of specific source classes, and the role of particle transport in shaping their
observed emission are central goals of modern UHE astrophysics. Here we report
the discovery of a giant UHE {\gamma}-ray emitter at -17.5{\deg} off the
Galactic plane - a region where UHE {\gamma}-ray sources are rarely found. The
emitter exhibits a distinctive asymmetric shape, resembling a giant "Peanut"
spanning 0.45{\deg} \times 4.6{\deg}, indicative of anisotropic particle
distribution over a large area. A highly aged millisecond pulsar (MSP)
J0218+4232 is the sole candidate accelerator positionally coincident with the
Peanut region. Its association with UHE {\gamma}-rays extending to 0.7 PeV, if
confirmed, would provide the first evidence of a millisecond pulsar powering
PeV particles. Such a finding challenges prevailing models, which posit that
millisecond pulsars cannot sustain acceleration to PeV energies. The detection
reveals fundamental gaps in understanding particle acceleration, cosmic-ray
transport, and interstellar magnetic field effects, potentially revealing new
PeV accelerator (PeVatron) classes.

### [8] [Hard X-ray view of two $γ$-ray detected low-luminosity active galactic nuclei: NGC 315 and NGC 4261](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06810)
*Yuwei Yu,Jin Zhang*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 该研究分析了两个低亮度活动星系核（LLAGNs）NGC 315和NGC 4261的X射线数据，发现它们的辐射特性不同，支持辐射无效吸积流（RIAF）作为主要X射线辐射源，并在NGC 4261中发现来自内喷流的附加软PL成分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在寻找低亮度活动星系核（LLAGNs）中辐射无效吸积流（RIAF）的辐射证据，并分析其辐射特性，以丰富未来对LLAGNs的研究样本。

Method: 通过分析NuSTAR和XMM-Newton观测获得的NGC 315和NGC 4261的X射线数据，结合时域和频谱分析。使用XSPEC对两种LLAGNs的联合X射线频谱进行多种功能形式和辐射模型的拟合。

Result: 对于NGC315和NGC4261，未发现天文学上的显著日变化。NGC315的X射线连续辐射适合用截止幂律（PL）拟合，截止能量为Ecut=18.45 keV，是目前为止LLAGNs中最低的值。相比之下，NGC4261的X射线连续辐射由两个PL成分组成，没有截止能量的迹象。NGC315中检测到了明显的中性Fe Kα线，而NGC4261中观测到电离的Fe XXV线。得出的反射率分别为R=0.61（NGC315）和R=0.18（NGC4579）。NGC315和NGC4261均无明显的康普顿反射峰。

Conclusion: X射线光谱特征支持RIAF辐射是这两个源的主要X射线辐射来源，尽管在NGC4261中观察到来自内喷流的额外软PL成分。NGC315中较高的反射率以及中性Fe Kα线的检测表明存在一个半径相对较小的截断吸积盘。NGC315中的轫致辐射似乎主导了等离子体的冷却机制，而NGC4261中的X射线发射则更可能由RIAF内的康普顿化过程引起。

Abstract: Aims. The accretion disk of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) is
a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). Our goal is to find evidence
of RIAF radiation from LLAGNs with jets and analyze their radiation properties,
which also adds samples to future research on LLAGNs. Methods. Weconducted an
analysis of the X-ray data obtained from NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of
NGC 315 and NGC 4261, encompassing both timing and spectral investigations. The
joint X-ray spectra of the two LLAGNs were fitted using various functional
forms and radiative models in XSPEC. Results. No significant variability on
timescales of days is observed for both NGC 315 and NGC 4261. The X-ray
continuum emission of NGC 315 is suitable for cutoff power-law (PL) fitting,
yielding a cutoff energy of Ecut = 18.45 keV, which is the lowest value found
in LLAGNssofar. In contrast, the X-ray continuum of NGC 4261 is composed of two
PL components, with no signs of a cutoff energy. A prominent neutral Fe
K{\alpha} line is observed in NGC 315, while an ionized Fe XXV line is seen in
NGC 4261. The derived reflection fractions are R = 0.61 for NGC 315 and R =
0.18 for NGC 4579. Neither NGC 315 nor NGC 4261 shows evidence of a Compton
reflection bump. Conclusions. The X-ray spectral characteristics support the
RIAF emission as the dominant origin of the X-rays in both sources, although an
additional soft PL component originating from the inner jet is observed in NGC
4261. The higher reflection fraction compared to other LLAGNs, along with the
detection of a neutral Fe K{\alpha} line, suggests the existence of a truncated
accretion disk with a relatively small radius in NGC 315. Bremsstrahlung
radiation appears to be the dominant cooling mechanism for the plasma in
NGC315, while Comptonization within the RIAF is more likely responsible for the
X-ray emission in NGC 4261.

Abstract: We present new broad-band X-ray results aimed at the identification and
characterization of four poorly studied hard X-ray transients discovered by
INTEGRAL: IGR J16426+6536, IGR J09446-2636, IGR J21268+6203, and IGR
J02447+7046. The key properties and X-ray behavior of these sources have
remained largely unknown until now. We investigated the temporal, spectral, and
energetic characteristics of their hard X-ray outbursts detected above 20 keV
by INTEGRAL. In addition, we performed a systematic analysis of unpublished
archival soft X-ray observations below 10 keV, enabling a full exploration of
their large INTEGRAL error circles in search of the most likely soft X-ray
counterparts. Within their arcsecond-sized X-ray error circles, we identified
single optical/near-infrared counterparts for each source. We analyzed their
photometric properties to constrain the nature of the systems. Our results show
that the X-ray properties of these four transients are inconsistent with the
previously proposed extragalactic AGN origin, and instead support a Galactic
nature for all of them. Specifically, we propose a very faint X-ray transient
classification for IGR J16426+6536, a nearby flaring star for IGR J09446-2636
and IGR J21268+6203, finally a gamma-ray binary nature for IGR J02447+7046.

TL;DR: 研究人员利用Firmamento平台对Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR4目录中的5,062个高银纬伽马射线源进行了系统重新评估，确认了大多数已知的源关联，发现了421个新的活动星系核（AGN）对应体，降低了未识别的源比例。

Motivation: 为了提供独立于传统方法的LAT伽马射线源关联评估，结合多频段数据并引入人工监督以提高准确性。

Method: 使用Firmamento平台，结合最近的和历史的调查数据，通过机器学习和基于模板的方法，同时进行光谱能分布、源形态、通量变化及模板比较的人工监督。

Result: 确认了4,493个案例的已知关联（88.8%），发现421个新的活动星系核对应体，以及64个替代的blazar关联，同时在49个案例中未确认4FGL-DR4的关联。通过机器学习和基于模板的方法，为所有确认的blazar对应体提供了同质化的同步辐射峰值频率和通量估计。

Conclusion: Firmamento平台通过结合多频段数据和人工监督，有效提高了对Fermi-LAT源的识别能力，尤其是对活动星系核的识别，为研究和教育提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We present a systematic reassessment of 5,062 high-Galactic latitude
gamma-ray sources from the Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR4 catalog using Firmamento, a
web-based platform for multi-frequency source discovery and analysis. Our goal
is to provide an independent evaluation of LAT gamma-ray source associations
through alternative spectral and spatial methods that combine recent and legacy
survey data, supplemented by human supervision of spectral energy distributions
(SEDs), source morphology, flux variability, and template-based comparisons.
Firmamento confirms the 4FGL-DR4 and 4LAC-DR3 counterparts or unassociated
sources in 4,493 cases (88.8%), demonstrating the robustness of both
approaches. Beyond this general agreement, we identify 421 new blazar
counterparts among previously unassociated sources, thereby reducing the
fraction of unidentified extragalactic Fermi-LAT sources from 25% to 17%. In
addition, in 64 cases we find alternative blazar associations, while in 49
instances we do not confirm the 4FGL-DR4 association. For all confirmed blazar
counterparts we provide homogeneous estimates of synchrotron peak frequency and
peak flux using machine-learning and template-based methods; these agree with
4LAC-DR3 values in most cases, though significant discrepancies appear for a
few dozen sources, often due to improved X-ray coverage. The primary outcome of
this work is the 1st Firmamento LAT AGN table (1FLAT), made publicly available
through the Firmamento platform (https://firmamento.nyuad.nyu.edu), where all
related multi-wavelength data and images are available. The project involved

Conclusion: 增强的完整性使得对能量分布的时间行为进行精细分析成为可能，显示出双峰能量分布是发射机制的固有特性，而非与爆发率共进化的结果。

Abstract: Active repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), with their large number of bursts,
burst energy distribution, and their potential energy evolution, offer critical
insights into the FRBs emission mechanisms. Traditional pipelines search for
bursts through conducting dedispersion trials and looking for signals above
certain fluence thresholds, both of which could result in missing weak and
narrow-band bursts. In order to improve the completeness of the burst set, we
develop an End-to-end DedispersE-agnostic Nonparametric AI model (EDEN), which
directly detect bursts from dynamic spectrum and is the first detection
pipeline that operates without attempting dedispersion. We apply EDEN to
archival FAST L-band observations during the extreme active phase of the
repeating source FRB 20121102A, resulting in the largest burst set for any FRB
to date, which contains 5,927 individual bursts, tripling the original burst
set. The much enhanced completeness enables a refined analysis of the temporal
behavior of energy distribution, revealing that the bimodal energy distribution
remains stable over time. It is rather an intrinsic feature of the emission
mechanisms than a consequence of co-evolving with burst rate.

Abstract: We extend the classical Keplerian framework of existing analytic TDE models
by incorporating the gravitational potential of a spherically symmetric
galactic mass distribution. We then demonstrate that this broader structure
imprints light curve features beyond the predictive scope of traditional
models, such as phases of shallower-than-standard decay and late-time
rebrightening episodes. Importantly, our framework predicts the occurrence of
environment-induced rebrightenings but only on very long timescales, unless the
host environment is unrealistically ultra-compact. This means the early
evolution of TDEs occurring in typical galaxies is essentially untouched by the
host potential, which explains why Keplerian models have been so successful in
describing the first few years after disruption. To illustrate, we applied our
model to the TDE candidate eRASSt J133157.9-324321 (J1331), the event with the
longest reported rebrightening interval, and find that even matching its
${\sim}$30-year rebrightening would demand an implausibly dense host. This
demonstrates the limits of environmental effects as an explanation for early
rebrightenings reported in the literature. More broadly, our work shows that
while the host galaxy leaves TDEs nearly Keplerian at early times, it actively
shapes their long-term evolution and can drive departures from the canonical
$t^{-5/3}$ decay law. These delayed signals give us a testable way to see how
the host galaxy shapes the event, and they may even offer clues about the
galaxy's underlying structure.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合地面观测数据的贝叶斯推理管道，用于分析空间带数据中的双黑洞系统，降低了检测阈值并提高了参数估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面观测数据能够显著缩小空间带分析的参数空间，从而大幅降低检测阈值，提高搜索效率。

Method: 利用从地面观测中获得的先验信息，开发了一个贝叶斯推断流程，对空间带数据进行分析，并考虑了轨道偏心率的影响。

Result: 使用一年的LISA或TianQin数据，能够将信噪比约7的类似GW190521的源识别出来，并精确约束其红移后的啁啾质量，将偏心率约束在约$10^{-5}$附近。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了在嘈杂的空间带数据中进行轨道偏心双黑洞系统的推断是可行的，支持多频段探测的扩展，增强了未来天体物理和引力波测试的前景。

Abstract: Space-based gravitational-wave observatories will detect the early inspiral
of stellar-mass binary black holes and can track their eccentricity evolution.
However, untargeted searches in the space band are computationally demanding
and require relatively high detection thresholds (signal-to-noise ratio $\sim
15$). Information from ground-based detections can significantly shrink the
parameter space for space-band analyses and thereby substantially reduce the
detection threshold. We present a Bayesian inference pipeline for
ground-triggered archival space-band analyses that includes eccentricity. Using
ground-informed priors, we demonstrate that with one year of LISA or TianQin
data a GW190521-like source with signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 7$ can be
distinguished and tightly constrained. In this setup, space observations
sharpened the redshifted chirp mass from $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})M_\odot$ to
$\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})M_\odot$, and constrain the eccentricity to
$\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ around the injected value $e_{0.01\mathrm{Hz}}=0.1$.
These results demonstrate that inference of eccentric stellar-mass binary black
holes in noisy space-band data is practically feasible, supports an expanded
yield of multiband detections, and strengthens prospects for future
astrophysical and gravitational tests.

Abstract: The production site and process responsible for the highly variable
high-energy emission observed from blazar jets are still debated. Gravitational
lenses can be used as microscopes to investigate the nature of such sources. We
study the broad-band spectral properties and the high-energy variability of the
gravitationally-lensed blazar PKS 1830-211, for which radio observations have
revealed two images, to put constraints on the jet physics and the existence of
a gravitationally-induced time delay and magnification ratio between the
images. We utilize Swift/XRT, Nustar, and Fermi-LAT observations from 2016 and
2019 to compare periods of low activity and high activity in PKS 1830-211.
Short-timescale variability is elucidated with an unbinned power spectrum
analysis of time-tagged NuSTAR photon data. To study the
gravitationally-induced time delay in the gamma-ray light curve observed with
Fermi-LAT, we improve existing autocorrelation function based methods. Our
modified auto-correlation method yields a delay of t_0=21.1 +/- 0.1 d and
magnification factor a=0.13 +/- 0.01. These parameters remain time-invariant.
In data from 2016 and 2019, the X-ray spectra remain remarkably stable,
contrasting with extreme changes in gamma-rays. Both states can be fitted with
a single component from Comptonisation of infrared emission from the dusty
torus, with different gamma-ray states arising solely from a shift in the break
of the electron energy distribution. The detection of a consistent lag
throughout the whole light curve suggests that they originate from a persistent
location in the jet.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: From gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A, very high-energy photons were detected:
>10 TeV with LHAASO and >100 TeV with Carpet-3. Such energetic photons are
expected to be absorbed via electron-positron pair production on their way to
the Earth. Their observation might be explained by new physics, including
Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) or photon mixing with axion-like particles
(ALPs). Here, we construct a joint fluence spectrum by combining flux
measurements from both experiments, and fit it under these hypotheses. LIV can
account for the Carpet-3 observation, providing a modest improvement over
standard physics in the overall fit. ALP mixing improves the description of
both LHAASO and Carpet-3 data, yielding a substantial enhancement in fit
quality for a specific region of the ALP parameter space.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are valuable probes of cosmic star formation reaching
back into the epoch of reionization, and a large dataset with known redshifts
($z$) is an important ingredient for these studies. Usually, $z$ is measured
using spectroscopy or photometry, but $\sim80\%$ of GRBs lack such data. Prompt
and afterglow correlations can provide estimates in these cases, though they
suffer from systematic uncertainties due to assumed cosmologies and due to
detector threshold limits. We use a sample with $z$ estimated via machine
learning models, based on prompt and afterglow parameters, without relying on
cosmological assumptions. We then use an augmented sample of GRBs with measured
and predicted redshifts, forming a larger dataset. We find that the predicted
redshifts are a crucial step forward in understanding the evolution of GRB
properties. We test three cases: no evolution, an evolution of the beaming
factor, and an evolution of all terms captured by an evolution factor
$(1+z)^\delta$. We find that these cases can explain the density rate in the
redshift range between 1-2, but neither of the cases can explain the derived
rate densities at smaller and higher redshifts, which may point towards an
evolution term different than a simple power law. Another possibility is that
this mismatch is due to the non-homogeneity of the sample, e.g., a
non-collapsar origin of some long GRB within the sample.

Abstract: Future gamma-ray survey instruments, such as newASTROGAM and AMEGO-X, will
significantly improve previous and current all-sky surveys at MeV energies. In
this paper we discuss the continuum emission from the Milky Way, two prominent
large extended sources, the Fermi bubbles and Loop I, and the extragalactic
gamma-ray background. We highlight the importance of measurements in the MeV to
GeV energy range for understanding CR production and propagation in the Galaxy,
for the determination of the nature of the Fermi bubbles and Loop I, and for
exploring the origin of the extragalactic gamma-ray background.
