Abstract: Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) generate powerful relativistic jets that inject a
large amount of energy into their surrounding environment, producing blast
waves that accelerate particles to high energies. The GRB afterglow radiation
provides a powerful means to investigate the microphysics of relativistic
shocks and to probe the medium surrounding the progenitor of the burst. In this
study, we present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of 31 GRBs observed
between 2008 and 2024 from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (X-ray Telescope
and Burst Alert Telescope) and the Fermi Large Area Telescope, covering photon
energies from 0.3 keV to 300 GeV. Our goal is to characterize the broadband
spectral properties of GRB afterglows in soft X-rays, hard X-rays, and
high-energy gamma rays. We investigate correlations between spectral shape and
energy output across different parts of the spectrum. The observed emission is
modeled using a forward shock scenario that includes both synchrotron and
synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation losses. The results favor an
SSC-dominated radiation model in a wind-like medium, consistent with
expectations for long-duration GRBs. Crucially, this work provides new
benchmarks for the microphysical parameters governing the emission,
particularly indicating a notably low magnetic energy fraction, which refines
previous estimates. By modeling broadband data, this study offers one of the
most detailed SSC analyses in a wind-like environment to date. Notably, our
results naturally account for the comparable energy output observed in both the
soft X-ray and TeV bands, consistent with the previously detected TeV-GRBs.

Abstract: We report the first polarimetric results of the neutron star (NS) low-mass
X-ray binary (LMXB) Z-source GX 17+2 using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry
Explorer (IXPE) and the Very Large Array (VLA). We find that the X-ray source
was polarized at PD = 1.9 +/- 0.3 % (1-sigma errors) with a polarization angle
of PA = 11 +/- 4 degree (1-sigma errors). Simultaneous Nuclear Spectroscopic
Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations show that the source was in the normal
branch (NB) during our IXPE observations. The X-ray spectro-polarimetry results
suggest a source geometry comprising an accretion disk component, a
Comptonization component, and a reflection component. The VLA radio
polarization study shows a PD = 2.2 +/- 0.2 % with a Faraday-corrected
intrinsic polarization angle of 1 +/- 5 degree, which is an indication of the
jet axis. Thus, we find the estimated X-ray PA from the source is consistent
with the radio PA. We discuss the accretion geometry of the Z-source in light
of our X-ray spectro-polarimetry and radio findings.

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts are flashes of high-energy radiation lasting from a fraction
of a second to several hours. Military satellites made the first detections of
GRBs in the late 1960s. The $\gamma$-ray emission forms from shocks in a
relativistic jet launched from a compact central engine. In addition to the
emission of $\gamma$-rays, the interaction of the jet with the surrounding
medium yields afterglow emission that can be observed across the
electromagnetic spectrum. Redshift measurements from these afterglows place
GRBs from the local to the distant Universe. The central engines of GRBs are
thought to be either a hyperaccreting black hole or a highly magnetized neutron
star (magnetar). There is now strong observational evidence that this central
engine is created either in the core collapse of a rapidly rotating massive
star or via the merger of two compact objects (neutron stars or a neutron star
with a black hole). The combination of stellar scale events with extreme
energies and luminosities makes GRBs powerful probes of the extreme physics
involved in their production and of other areas of astrophysics and cosmology.
These include as the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave
sources, the production and acceleration of relativistic jets, the synthesis of
heavy elements, the study of the interstellar and intergalactic medium, and the
identification of the collapse of early generations of stars.

Abstract: Scalar-tensor gravity models are among the prime candidates to explain cosmic
acceleration, and compact stars provide unique laboratories for testing such
theories. Predictions of scalar-tensor gravity in compact stars can be examined
during the evolution of neutron stars. Spontaneous scalarization in
relativistic stars is influenced by different properties of stellar matter in
various evolution regimes. In the present study, we investigate the
scalarization of neutron stars in different stages of the evolvement. For this
aim, we apply the isentropic equations of state for the neutron star matter
including nucleons, hyperons, and $\Delta$- resonances in neutrino-trapped,
neutrino diffusion, and neutrino-transparent stages as well as cold-catalyzed
neutron star. Our equations of state are based on the relativistic model within
the mean-field approximation. To emphasize the role of scalar-tensor theories
in exploring the properties and structure of compact stars, we calculate the
structure of neutron stars with hyperons and $\Delta$-resonances in different
snapshots of the neutron star evolution in the scalar-tensor gravity. Our
calculations confirm that the neutron star scalarization is affected by the
hyperons as well as the $\Delta$-resonances. Moreover, the properties of
scalarized neutron stars depend on the stage of the star evolution.

### [5] [On the statistical characterization of the synchrotron multi-zone polarization of blazars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05324)
*Andrea Tramacere*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper studies blazars' multiwavelength polarization behavior, finds it complex and energy-dependent, and proposes a multi-zone turbulent jet model to explain these observations without needing cell size-EED parameter correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blazars' polarization patterns in different wavelengths challenge simple models, suggesting a more complex jet structure with multiple emission zones.

Method: Developed a statistical framework using Monte Carlo simulations with JetSeT code to model synthetic multi-zone synchrotron emissions from turbulent cells with random properties.

Result: The model successfully reproduces observed polarization trends across mm-to-X-ray bands and optical polarization limits using a purely turbulent approach without correlations between cell size and EED parameters.

Conclusion: Blazars' polarization behavior can be explained by multi-zone turbulent jet structures, with polarization degree influenced by the number of emitting cells and dispersion in cell properties like EED cutoff and low-energy slope.

Abstract: Multiwavelength polarimetric observations of blazars reveal complex,
energy-dependent polarization behavior, including a decrease in polarization
fraction from X-rays to millimeter bands and significant variability in the
electric vector position angle (EVPA). These trends challenge simple
single-zone synchrotron models and suggest a more intricate, turbulent jet
structure with multiple emission zones. We develop a statistical framework to
model the observed energy-dependent polarization patterns in blazars, focusing
on the behavior captured by IXPE in the X-ray band and RoboPol in the optical.
The goal is to statistically characterize multi-zone models in terms of the
distributions of cell size and the physical parameters of the electron energy
distribution (EED). A Monte Carlo approach, implemented with the JetSeT code,
is used to generate synthetic multi-zone synchrotron emission from a spherical
region filled with turbulent cells with randomly distributed physical
properties. Simulations explore scenarios ranging from identical cells to
power-law distributions of cell sizes and EED parameters with variable cutoff
and low-energy slopes. The results show that a purely turbulent, multi-zone
model can reproduce the observed energy-dependent polarization without
requiring correlations between cell size and EED parameters. The polarization
degree is primarily determined by the effective, flux-weighted, number of
emitting cells, modulated by the dispersion in cell properties, particularly
the EED cutoff energy at high frequencies and the low-energy spectral index at
low frequencies. With a fractional dispersion in cutoff energy of about 90% and
a low-energy spectral index dispersion of ~0.5-1.5, the model reproduces the
chromatic mm-to-X-ray polarization trends seen by IXPE and the optical
polarization limiting envelope observed in the RoboPol dataset.

Abstract: We present the analysis of the luminous Type II Supernova (SN) 2021tsz, which
exploded in a low-luminosity galaxy. It reached a peak magnitude of -18.88
$\pm$ 0.13 mag in the $r$ band and exhibited an initial rapid decline of 4.05
$\pm$ 0.14 mag (100 d)$^{-1}$ from peak luminosity till $\sim$30 d. The
photospheric phase is short, with the SN displaying bluer colours and a weak
H$\alpha$ absorption component--features consistent with other luminous,
short-photospheric phase Type II SNe. A distinct transition from the
photospheric to the radioactive tail phase in the $V$ band--as is common in
hydrogen-rich Type II SNe--is not visible in SN 2021tsz, although a modest
$\sim$1 mag drop is apparent in the redder filters. Hydrodynamic modelling
suggests the luminosity is powered by ejecta-circumstellar material (CSM)
interaction during the early phases (<30 days). Interaction with 0.6 M$_\odot$
of dense CSM extending to 3100 R$_\odot$ reproduces the observed luminosity,
with an explosion energy of 1.3$\times$10$^{51}$ erg. The modelling indicates a
pre-SN mass of 9 M$_\odot$, which includes a hydrogen envelope of 4 M$_\odot$,
and a radius of $\sim$1000 R$_\odot$. Spectral energy distribution analysis and
strong-line diagnostics reveal that the host galaxy of SN 2021tsz is a
low-metallicity, dwarf galaxy. The low-metallicity environment and the derived
high mass loss from the hydrodynamical modelling strongly support a binary
progenitor system for SN 2021tsz.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We have utilized the largest sample of $\gamma$-ray selected Fermi
flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) ever used (519 sources) to construct the
luminosity function and its evolution through the cosmic history. In addition
to spanning large redshift ($0<z\lesssim 4$) and luminosity ranges
($2.9\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ - $7.3\times10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$), this
sample also has a robust calculation of the detection efficiency associated
with its observation, making its selection effects and biases well understood.
We confirm that the local luminosity function is best explained by a double
power law. The evolution of the luminosity function of FSRQs follows a
luminosity-dependent density evolution. FSRQs experience positive evolution
with their space density growing with increasing redshift up to a maximum
redshift, after which the numbers decrease. This peak in redshift occurs at
larger redshifts for higher luminosity sources and at lower redshifts for lower
luminosity sources. We find an unexpected similarity between the luminosity
function of FSRQs and that of BL Lacertae objects at intermediate luminosity.
This could be a sign of a strong genetic link between the two blazar
sub-classes or that BL Lac samples are contaminated by large amounts of FSRQs
with their jets nearly perfectly aligned with our line of sight.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了盘-冕耦合场景下的时间尺度分层：快速DRW < SHO < 盘DRW < 冕DRW，可能由磁旋转不稳定性驱动的相干振荡引起。

Abstract: We analyzed Insight-HXMT data of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630
during the type-B QPO phase of its 2019 outburst. Using the Gaussian process
method, we applied an additive composite kernel model consisting of an SHO, a
DRW, and an additional white noise (AWN) to data from three energy bands: LE
(1-10 keV), ME (10-30 keV), and HE (30-150 keV). We find that for the DRW
component, correlations on the timescale of $\tau_{\rm DRW}\sim10$ s are absent
in the LE band, while they persist in the ME and HE bands over the full
duration of the light curves. This energy-dependent behavior may reflect
thermal instabilities, with the shorter correlation timescale in the disk
compared to the corona. Alternatively, it may reflect variable Comptonizations
of seed photons from different disk regions. Inner-disk photons are scattered
by a small inner corona, producing soft X-rays. Outer-disk photons interact
with an extended, jet-like corona, resulting in harder emission. The QPO is
captured by an SHO component with a stable period of $\sim 0.2$ s and a high
quality factor of $\sim 10$. The absence of significant evolution with energy
or time of the SHO component suggests a connection between the accretion disk
and the corona, which may be built by coherent oscillations of disk-corona
driven by magnetorotational instability. The AWN components are present in all
the three-band data and dominate over the DRW and SHO components. We interpret
the AWN as another fast DRW with its $\tau_{\rm DRW} < 0.01$ s. It may trace
high-frequency fluctuations that occur in both the inner region of the
accretion disk and the corona. Overall, our work reveals a timescale hierarchy
in the coupled disk-corona scenario: fast DRW < SHO < disk DRW < corona DRW.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive long-term multi-wavelength study of the active
galactic nucleus (AGN) NGC 3822, based on 17 years (2008 to 2025) of X-ray,
ultraviolet (UV), and optical observations.The dataset includes observations
from Swift, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, the Very Large Telescope, and the Himalayan
Chandra Telescope. Our multiwavelength light curve analysis reveals flux
variations across X-ray to optical/UV bands, with an increased variability
amplitude at shorter wavelengths. X-ray spectral analysis indicates the
presence of intrinsic absorption during the 2016 and 2022 observations;
however, this absorption disappeared before and after these epochs. The
presence and absence of the absorber are attributed to clouds moving in and out
of the line of sight. During the long-term monitoring period, the bolometric
luminosity of the source varies between ($1.32-17)\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
Optical spectroscopic monitoring reveals changing-look (CL) behaviour in
NGC~3822, characterized by the appearance and disappearance of broad emission
lines (BELs). These CL transitions are associated with changes in the Eddington
ratio rather than changes in the obscuration. The BELs appear only when the
Eddington ratio is relatively high ($\sim 3.8\times10^{-3}$) and disappear when
it drops to a lower value ($\sim 0.9\times10^{-3}$).

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 该研究利用29个具有高时间分辨率特性和已知红移的FRB样本，分析其固有宽度和散射分布，发现它们与之前假设的对数正态分布不同，而是分别呈现对数均匀分布和高斯分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FRB的固有宽度和散射分布影响其发射机制和局部环境的研究，并且是检测偏差和人口统计及宇宙学研究中的干扰因素。

Method: 作者使用来自ASKAP望远镜的CRAFT巡天数据，对29个FRB样本进行建模，估计固有宽度和散射测量的完整性偏差，并拟合脱偏后的分布。

Result: 固有散射分布在1 GHz处0.04毫秒以上与对数均匀分布一致，而固有宽度分布在0.03-0.3毫秒范围内呈高斯分布，超过该范围则为对数均匀分布。这一结果与之前的对数正态分布假设有冲突。

Conclusion: FRB观测目前受到宽度和散射的强烈限制，应鼓励扩展到更高的时间宽度进行搜索。同时，这暗示了FRB宿主星系研究中的偏差，尽管具体形式尚不确定。更新的宽度和散射模型在zDM代码中能产生比替代模型10%更多的z=1红移的FRB。

Abstract: The intrinsic width and scattering distributions of fast radio bursts (FRBs)
inform on their emission mechanism and local environment, and act as a source
of detection bias and, hence, an obfuscating factor when performing FRB
population and cosmological studies. Here, we utilise a sample of 29 FRBs with
measured high-time-resolution properties and known redshift, which were
detected using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) by the
Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients Survey (CRAFT), to model these
distributions. Using this sample, we estimate the completeness bias of
intrinsic width and scattering measurements, and fit the underlying, de-biased
distributions in the host rest-frame. We find no evidence for a down-turn
towards high values of the intrinsic distributions of either parameter in the
0.01-40 ms range probed by the data. Rather, the intrinsic scattering
distribution at 1 GHz is consistent with a log-uniform distribution above 0.04
ms, while the intrinsic width distribution rises as a Gaussian in log-space in
the 0.03-0.3 ms range, and is then log-uniform above that. This is inconsistent
with previous works, which assumed that these parameters have lognormal
distributions. This confirms that FRB observations are currently strongly
width- and scattering-limited, and we encourage FRB searches to be extended to
higher values of time-width. It also implies a bias in FRB host galaxy studies,
although the form of that bias is uncertain. Finally, we find that our updated
width and scattering model - when implemented in the zDM code - produces 10%
more FRBs at redshift $z=1$ than at $z=0$ when compared to alternative
width/scattering models, highlighting that these factors are important to
understand when performing FRB population modelling.

Conclusion: 这些差异对当前的发射和加速模型提出挑战，需要更复杂的理论框架来解释。

Abstract: Extremely high-peaked BL Lac objects (or extreme blazars) are unique
extragalactic laboratories where particle acceleration processes are pushed at
their physical limits. In these blazars, synchrotron emission peaking above keV
energies is reprocessed to very-high-energy (VHE, energies > 100 GeV) gamma
rays, often resulting in very hard TeV spectra. Over the past two decades, they
have attracted a growing interest from the scientific community, both
experimentally and theoretically, as crucial targets for understanding the
diversity within the blazar class. On the experimental side, new sources have
been detected and characterized, populating the extreme blazars class. Notably,
VHE campaigns have revealed evidence of emerging spectral differences in this
energy band, suggesting inhomogeneity within this class of sources. Recent
studies have also unveiled intriguing differences in the temporal evolution of
their spectral emission. On the theoretical side, these spectral differences
are challenging the current standard emission and acceleration models for
blazars, suggesting the need for more complex theoretical frameworks. In this
contribution, we present the latest results from recent MAGIC Collaboration
observing campaigns aimed to enlarge the extreme blazars population at VHE and
understand the origin of their extreme properties. Furthermore, we will present
the results of the most recent observations, discussing analogies and
differences with well-known sources such as the archetypal 1ES 0229+200, as
well as interpretations of their non-conventional spectral emission.

Abstract: The identification of $\gamma$-rays from the predominant hadronic-background
is a key aspect in their ground-based detection using Imaging Atmospheric
Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). While current methods are limited in their
ability to exploit correlations in complex data, deep learning-based models
offer a promising alternative by directly leveraging image-level information.
However, several challenges involving the robustness and applicability of such
models remain. Designing model architectures with inductive biases relevant for
the task can help mitigate the problem. Three such deep learning-based models
are proposed, trained, and evaluated on simulated data: (1) a hybrid
convolutional and graph neural network model (CNN-GNN) using both image and
graph data; (2) an enhanced CNN-GNN variant that incorporates additional
reconstructed information within the graph construction; and (3) a graph neural
network (GNN) model using image moments serving as a baseline. The new combined
convolution and graph-based approach demonstrates improved performance over
traditional methods, and the inclusion of reconstructed information offers
further potential in generalization capabilities on real observational data.

Abstract: A striking aspect of the radio profiles of many millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is
that they consist of components separated from each other by regions lacking in
emission. We devise a technique for determining "disjoint" from "contiguous"
components and show that 35% of MSPs have disjoint components as opposed to
only 3% of the slow pulsar population. We surmise that the pulsars with these
disjoint components show evidence for both emission above the polar cap and
from the current sheet beyond the light cylinder, co-located with gamma-ray
emission. For a sub-class of radio MSPs only the light cylinder emission is
being observed. It is our contention that almost all of the current population
of gamma-ray MSPs show evidence for co-located radio emission. A simple
geometric explanation allows the presence (or not) of light cylinder emission
and the relationship (or not) between the gamma-ray and radio profiles to be
determined. The light-cylinder components have frequently very high
polarization and typically flat position-angle traverses thus helping to
explain the difficulties in determining the geometry of MSPs. In cases where
the geometry can be determined the values broadly align with expectations. If
our picture is correct, the beaming fraction of radio MSPs is higher than
previously thought and a mechanism is required to produce coherent radio
emission far from the stellar surface. This has implications for our
understanding of the populations of radio-loud and radio-quiet rotation-powered
millisecond pulsars, and could relate to the timing stability of some of these
sources.

Abstract: Very-high energy (VHE; $>$100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray emission originates via some
of the most extreme particle acceleration processes in the universe.
Considering beamed active galactic nuclei, i.e., blazars, only a small
fraction, mainly high synchrotron peak BL Lacs, have been detected in the VHE
band with the ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. We utilized $\sim$16 years of
Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations in the 0.1$-$2 TeV energy range
to systematically search for potential VHE emitters in a sample of high
synchrotron peaked ($\nu^{\rm peak}_{\rm syn}>10^{15}$ Hz) BL Lac sources. We
identified, for the first time, 92 VHE emitting blazars at $\geq 5\sigma$
confidence level. A significant VHE emission was also detected from 52 objects,
which have been previously reported to be a VHE blazar. Comparing with the
general blazar population, these VHE emitting blazars are found to be located
at low redshifts (mean $z=0.2 \pm 0.1$) and exhibit bright synchrotron emission
($\log F^{\rm peak}_{\rm syn}=-11.2 \pm 0.4$, in erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$). We
also investigated the coincidence of VHE photon arrivals with the source
activity states and found that Fermi-LAT has detected VHE photons during both
quiescent and elevated activity epochs. These VHE emitting blazars represent
promising targets for current and next-generation ground-based Cherenkov
telescopes, and provide valuable laboratories for probing particle acceleration
in relativistic jets, testing multi-messenger connections, and constraining
extragalactic background light models.

Abstract: We evaluate the contribution to the Isotropic Gamma-Ray Background (IGRB)
coming from Radio Galaxies (RGs), the subclass of radio-loud Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN) with the highest misalignment from the line of sight (l.o.s.).
Since only a small number of RGs are detected in gamma rays compared to the
largest known radio population, the correlation between radio and gamma-ray
emission serves as a crucial tool to characterize the gamma-ray properties of
these sources. We analyse the population of RGs using two samples. The first
sample contains 26 sources individually detected by the Large Area Telescope
(LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope at gamma rays. The second
sample contains 210 RGs for which the gamma-ray emission is not significantly
detected by the LAT. We use a stacking analysis to characterize the average
properties of the gamma-ray emission of the two samples, separately at first
and then combined. We then evaluate the correlation between their gamma-ray
emission and the emission from their radio core at 5 GHz, and we use it to
determine their contribution to the IGRB. Due to the limited number of RGs
detected at the gamma-rays, information on the gamma-ray luminosity function is
limited. The correlation between the gamma-ray emission and the emission of the
radio core allows us to characterize it starting from the luminosity function
of the radio cores, which is modeled with greater accuracy due to the larger
number of sources detected at these frequencies. We find that the diffuse
emission as extrapolated from the properties of the subthreshold RGs is lower
than the one inferred from detected RGs, showing that the contribution of the
population of RGs to the IGRB is lower than the previous estimates and it is
around the 30% level of the IGRB intensity.

Abstract: The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays remains one of the central open
questions in astroparticle physics. Recent measurements reveal anisotropies in
arrival directions, a rigidity-dependent composition dominated by
intermediate-mass nuclei, and striking hemispheric differences in the energy
spectra. Here we show that rare transients in nearby galaxies can naturally
account for these features. In our fiducial neutron-star merger model, the
cosmic ray flux above $25$ EeV is dominated by ten nearby galaxies within
$8\,$Mpc. This accounts for the observed hotspots: seven of the ten brightest
galaxies coincide with reported excess regions, a chance probability of
$p\simeq0.003$. Nearby transients also explain the spectral excess of TA over
Auger; link their angular sizes to extragalactic magnetic fields at $\sim$1 nG;
explain the dominance of individual species over narrow energy ranges; and the
rigidity-aligned succession of isotopes.
