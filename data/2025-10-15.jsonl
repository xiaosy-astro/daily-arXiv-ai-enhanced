However, in many systems\nthe mass transfer terminates prematurely in a dynamical instability at orbital\nperiods of a few days, culminating in the BH plunging into the donor and\npotentially disrupting and accreting its helium core at highly super-Eddington\nrates. Combining a suite of binary evolution models with analytic estimates and\npopulation synthesis, we predict the population of luminous transients from\ndelayed dynamical instability (DDI) and attribute them to the \"luminous\" class\nof fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs). The initial plunge of the BH into the\npartially stripped envelope typically ejects $\\sim 10M_{\\odot}$ of\nH/He-enriched material at speeds $\\sim 10^{2}-10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$, generating a\ncompact circumstellar medium (CSM) of radius $\\lesssim 1000R_{\\odot}$ by the\ntime the BH meets and tidally disrupts the HeC.

Using the full currently available\nInsight-HXMT dataset from July 2017 to June 2023, we make a comprehensive\nspectral-timing analysis of this source and report four main findings. First,\nwe uncover a QPO frequency rising branch between MJD 58206 and 58230, where the\ncentroid frequency increases from $\\sim$2 Hz to $\\sim$6 Hz, consistent with a\nspectral state transition from the hard to intermediate state.

Second, we identify a previously unreported Flare 3\nduring the obscured state, which shows distinct spectral and timing properties\ncompared to the earlier flares. Third, we detect sub-Hz QPOs (<1 Hz) in all\nthree flares, specifically at $\\sim$0.01 Hz in Flare 1 and $\\sim$0.2 Hz in both\nFlares 2 and 3.

At the peak of the flare, the source\nundergoes a brief transition from the hard-intermediate state (HIMS) into the\nsoft-intermediate state (SIMS), marked by the simultaneous appearance of three\ndiscrete radio jet ejections, a drop in broadband noise in the 2$-$10 keV band,\nand the presence of a narrow quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) with a\ncharacteristic ``U''-shaped phase-lag spectrum and a quality factor of $Q \\geq\n6$, features that robustly identify it as a Type-B QPO. The Type-C QPO, which\nwas clearly detected in the HIMS prior to the flare, is not observed at the\nflare's peak and only reappears afterward. Most notably, we find that the\nType-B QPO is not restricted to the SIMS: it is present throughout all our\nobservations, including those taken in the HIMS, where it appears as a broad\nshoulder of the Type-C QPO. During the flare, the Type-B and Type-C QPOs\nexhibit distinct evolutionary trends in frequency, fractional rms amplitude,\nand phase lag. These results challenge the traditional view that Type-B QPOs\nare exclusive to the SIMS, a state that is, in fact, defined by their\nappearance in the power spectrum, and directly linked to discrete jet\nejections.

Therefore,\nthese astrophysical objects are promising candidates for studying high-energy\nelectron--positron interactions, such as the production of $W^{\\pm}$ and $Z$\nbosons. In this work, we explore the implications of electron--positron\nannihilation processes in the jet environments of FSRQs, focusing on the\nresonant production of electroweak bosons and their potential contribution to\nthe diffuse neutrino flux. By modeling the electron distribution in the jet of\nthe FSRQ 3C~279 during a flaring state, we calculate the reaction rates for\n$W^{\\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons and estimate the resulting diffuse fluxes from the\ncosmological population of FSRQs. We incorporate the FSRQ luminosity function\nand its redshift evolution to account for the population distribution across\ncosmic time, finding that the differential flux contribution exhibits a\npronounced peak at redshift $z \\sim 1$. While the expected fluxes remain well\nbelow the detection thresholds of current neutrino observatories such as\nIceCube, KM3NeT, or Baikal-GVD, the expected flux from the $Z$ boson production\ncould account for approximately $10^{-3}$ of the total diffuse astrophysical\nneutrino flux. These results provide a theoretical benchmark for the role of\nStandard Model electroweak processes in extreme astrophysical environments and\nemphasize the interplay between particle physics and astrophysics, illustrating\nthat even rare high-energy interactions can leave a subtle but quantifiable\nimprint on the diffuse astrophysical neutrinos."}

Their flux is\nknown to vary along the orbit, from radio to X-rays. During the past decade,\ngamma-ray orbital modulation (GOM) has been discovered in a handful of spiders,\nbut its origin remains largely unknown. We present the results of a systematic\nsearch for GOM among 43 systems, selecting pulsed 0.1-1 GeV photons and using\nspin and orbital ephemeris from Fermi's Third Pulsar Catalog. We discover GOM\nfrom three spiders - PSR J1124-3653, PSR J1946-5403 and PSR J2215+5135 - and\nconfirm four previous detections. In all seven cases so far, the GOM peaks near\nthe pulsar's superior conjunction.
