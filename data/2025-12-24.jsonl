Distributions and Spectra of PeV Cosmic Rays around Microquasars", "comment": "6 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "In the standard Galactic cosmic-ray (CR) paradigm, protons are accelerated up to ~1 PeV by Galactic sources. While supernova remnants (SNRs) have been traditionally considered as the primary accelerators, recent observations by LHAASO and HAWC have detected very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays exceeding 100 TeV from several microquasars, suggesting that these X-ray binaries can accelerate CRs beyond 1 PeV. We investigate the escape process of CRs from microquasars, focusing on the energy-dependent transport mechanisms. High-energy CRs are likely to have long mean free paths and move ballistically on scales smaller than their mean free path, while lower-energy CRs undergo diffusive propagation. This transition results in a spectral break in the CR distribution around the microquasar. We calculate CR energy spectra within a 10-30 pc radius for various diffusion coefficients and timescales. Our model predicts a spectral break and hardening at E_p ~10-100 TeV when the standard diffusion coefficient for the interstellar space is assumed. However, current VHE gamma-ray observations do not show clear spectral breaks, suggesting that the diffusion coefficient may be significantly reduced near microquasars, possibly due to magnetic field amplification by CR-driven turbulence."}

Recent observations of the gravitationally lensed LRD R2211-RX1 reveal century-scale photometric variability and a hysteresis loop in the luminosity-temperature plane, strongly suggesting that the optical emission originates from a pulsating, stellar-like photosphere rather than an accretion disk. This supports the \"quasi-star\" hypothesis, where a rapidly growing black hole seed is embedded within a massive, radiation-pressure supported envelope. In this work, we investigate the stability of these envelopes using the stellar evolution code MESA coupled with the non-adiabatic oscillation code GYRE. We identify a theoretical \"Quasi-Star Instability Strip\" with a blue edge at $T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 5000-5200$ K. Models hotter than this threshold are stable, consistent with the non-variable LRD R2211-RX2 ($T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 5000$ K), while cooler models are unstable to radial pulsations driven by the $κ$-mechanism in helium and hydrogen ionization zones. For quasi-star masses in the range $M_\\star \\sim 10^4-10^5 M_\\odot$, we find that the unstable fundamental radial modes ($\\ell =0$, n$_{\\rm p}=1$) have periods in the range $\\sim 20-180$ years. The first overtone ($\\ell =0$, n$_{\\rm p}=2$) is also unstable or marginally stable in some of our models, with typical pulsation timescales $\\sim 10-30$ years. These oscillations match the co-moving frame variability timescale of RX1. We argue that these violent pulsations likely drive enhanced mass loss analogous to super-AGB winds, which could affect the duration of the quasi-star phase and regulate the final mass of the seeded black hole."}

The method is based on constructing constrained Brownian bridges, whose correlation properties can be tuned at will allowing flexibility between a conservative prior and a theory-informed prior.

Using a force-free Beltrami configurations as representative equilibria of magnetically dominated outflows, we demonstrate that Lorentz mapping of stationary helical magnetic field produces quasi-periodic modulation of observable electromagnetic signatures, without invoking intrinsic plasma variability. This effect may be described as an aberration of force-free magnetic fields under Lorentz transformation. The characteristic frequency of the time variability is determined by the helical wave-number of the magnetic field, the viewing angle, and the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet outflow, and scales linearly with $Γ$. This establishes a purely kinematic relativistic origin of variability and introduces the concept of magnetic Lorentz seismology: the inference of magnetic field structure in relativistic outflows directly from observed temporal variability."}

Crucially, we detect significant energy-dependent shifts in the centroids of two excess regions: Region B and the newly identified Region $\\mathrm{\\widetilde{D}}$. We also characterize the energy evolution of the fractional relative intensity across both excess and deficit regions. These findings imply that the observed anisotropies are shaped by the specific realization of the local turbulent magnetic field within the cosmic ray scattering length.

Early alerts favored a neutron-star-containing merger, making this a compelling target. Motivated by theoretical predictions of coherent radio bursts from mergers involving a neutron star, we utilized the OVRO-LWA Time Machine system to analyze voltage data recorded around the time of the event. The Time Machine is a two-stage voltage buffer and processing pipeline that continuously buffers raw data from all antennas across the array's nearly full-hemisphere instantaneous field of view, enabling retrospective beamforming, dedispersion, and fast-transient candidate identification. For this event, we analyzed a 30-minute interval beginning 3.5 minutes after the merger, which included two minutes of pre-alert data recovered by the ring buffer. We searched the 50% localization probability region with millisecond time resolution in the 69-86 MHz frequency band. No radio counterpart was detected above a 7-sigma fluence detection threshold of ~150 Jy ms. Using Bayesian analysis, we place a 95% confidence upper limit on the source luminosity of L95 = 4 x 10^41 erg s^-1. These constraints start to probe the bright end of the coherent-emission parameter space predicted by jet-ISM shock processes, magnetar and blitzar-like mechanisms, and recent simulation-based scenarios for neutron-star-containing mergers. This study presents the first sensitive, large-area, millisecond-timescale search for prompt low-frequency radio emission from a GW merger with the OVRO-LWA, establishing a framework in which about ten additional events will yield stringent population-level constraints."}

It is commonly accepted that, for low mass transfer rates, an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) is present in the inner region. But the observed relativistically broadened emission lines in the reflection spectra clearly indicate the existence of discs near the innermost stable circular orbit $(R_{\\rm{ISCO}})$. We investigate the interaction between the coronal flow and the disc in neutron star LMXBs, and find that gas condensation from the dominant, coronal accretion flow to an inner disc is enhanced as compared to that in black hole LMXBs as a consequence of irradiation of the corona by the neutron star surface. Computations show that for low mass transfer rates ($\\sim 0.005-0.02$ Eddington rate) a persistent weak disc can coexist with a coronal flow in the innermost region, where a pure ADAF would have been expected. The inner disc extends outwards from $R_{\\rm{ISCO}}$ to $\\sim 10 R_{\\rm{ISCO}}$ for Eddington ratios ($L/L_{\\rm{Edd}}$) as low as $\\sim 0.002$, covers a larger region for higher Eddington ratios, and eventually connects to the outer disc at $L/L_{\\rm{Edd}} \\sim 0.02$, thereby transiting to a soft state. We demonstrate that the observationally inferred region of the broad iron lines in the hard-state sources generally lies within the extension of the inner discs predicted by the condensation model. Disappearance of the broad iron lines is predicted at very low luminosities, either caused by very low accretion rates or disc truncation by strong magnetic fields."}

As a result, for the first time, we identify the quantitative requirements on local physical conditions. To reproduce the abundances ratios in the VMP stars, the explosive nucleosynthesis should take place under the neutrino exposure, which is time integration of neutrino flux, of $σ_ν\\sim 10^{35}\\,\\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}}$ and temperature of $2.0\\,\\mathrm{GK}\\leq T \\leq 3.2\\,\\mathrm{GK}$. The dependence on the density and each value of the neutrino flux and the duration of nucleosynthesis is weak. We also discuss whether the quantitative requirements are realized during the explosion. Although the requirements are difficult to be realized in the one-dimensional simulations, the non-monotonic thermal evolution shown in recent three-dimensional simulations may satisfy them. Because the evolution is likely caused by turbulent motion stemming from the initial asphericity of the progenitor, it is important to calculate the long-term three-dimensional supernova explosion of multi-dimensional metal-free progenitor models and follow the nucleosynthesis self-consistently."}

Their relativistic jets, closely aligned to the line of sight from Earth, are a rich and complex environment, characterised by the presence of strong magnetic fields over parsec-scale lengths. Owing to their cosmological distance from Earth, these sources serve as ideal targets to probe non-standard gamma-ray propagation. In particular, axion-like particles (ALPs) could be detected through their coupling to photons, which enables ALP-photon conversions in external magnetic fields, leading to distinct signatures in the blazars' gamma-ray spectra. In this work, we explore a novel approach to constrain the ALP parameter space using gamma-ray observations, based on the use of machine-learning classifiers. We apply this technique to simulated observations of two bright blazars -- Mrk 501 and PKS 2155$-$304 -- with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), a next-generation gamma-ray facility well suited to probe such features, thanks to its improved energy resolution and point-source sensitivity with respect to present ground-based gamma-ray telescopes. The obtained $2σ$ exclusion regions on the ALP parameter space are consistent with those found by applying a standard likelihood-ratio test, and suggest that the CTAO sensitivity to ALPs could be extended beyond existing constraints over a wide mass range."}

A maximum-likelihood approach is used to extract fluxes in the 20--2000 keV energy range. Stellar evolution models are employed to obtain the expected spectral shapes of ALP production processes peaking between 50--500 keV, depending on stellar mass and evolutionary stage. We construct a joint likelihood that incorporates uncertainties in stellar parameters to derive combined constraints on the coupling constants $g_{aγ}$ and $g_{ae}$ as a function of the ALP mass $m_a$. The hard X-ray and soft $γ$-ray fluxes of all selected stars are consistent with zero within uncertainties.

The prompt detection of such neutrino signals offers a unique opportunity to trigger early follow-up observations in the EM domain. We aim to assess the feasibility and efficiency of an optical-NIR follow-up strategy for CCSNe discovered via neutrino bursts, by modelling the spatial distribution of events and simulating realistic observational campaigns taking into account the size of the localization error box generated by triangulating the neutrino burst. We modelled the Galactic distribution of CCSNe, including the effects of interstellar extinction, and considered three main progenitor types: Wolf-Rayet stars, red and blue supergiants. We included the shock breakout in the EM signatures that could be detected following the neutrino burst. A population of CCSNe was generated and detected by different networks of neutrino observatories, including IceCube, KM3NeT, Super-Kamiokande, Hyper-Kamiokande, and JUNO. The resulting skymaps were used as input for GWEMOPT to produce optimized follow-up plans with two optical facilities: LSST and the TAROT robotic telescopes. Both LSST and TAROT exhibit comparable detection efficiencies for the simulated CCSN population. However, the TAROT network achieves similar success rates while requiring fewer pointings to cover the CCSN skymap. Our simulations demonstrate that neutrino follow-up campaigns can effectively CCSN optical counterparts using both large and small facilities. Depending on the neutrino network, the median number of pointings for the two tested optical facilities is of the order of 20 to 100 to find the EM emission. The number of images is larger for LSST than for TAROT by a factor of 2 to 4."}

Machine learning (ML) is an emerging tool that is useful in drawing valuable science out of incomprehensibly large datasets, identifying complex trends in data that are otherwise overlooked. Moreover, ML can potentially enhance the quality and quantity of scientific data as it is collected. This paper explores how a new ML method can improve the rate of classification of rare Ic-BL supernovae (SNe). New parameters called magnitude rates were introduced to train ML models to identify SNe Ic-BL in large datasets. The same methodology was applied to a population of SN Ia transients to see if the methodology could be reproducible with another SN class. Three magnitudes, three time differences, two magnitude rates and the second derivative of these rates were calculated using the first three available photometric data points in a single filter. Initial investigations show that the Random Forest algorithm provides a strong foundation for the early classifications SNe Ic-BL and SNe Ia. Testing this model again on an unseen dataset shows that the model can identify upward of 13% of the total true SN Ic-BL population, significantly improving upon current methods. By implementing a dedicated observation campaign using this model, the number of SN Ic-BL classified and the quality of early-time data collected each year will see considerable growth in the near future."}

The absence of TeV gamma-rays from NGC~1068 indicates neutrino production in compact gamma-ray-opaque region. The vicinity of the supermassive black hole, such as disk-corona, is an ideal region, where the high radiation density leads to efficient neutrino production as well as the gamma-ray attenuation. Disk-corona models predict that the neutrino emission from AGNs correlates with X-ray emission, which traces the coronal activity. In this paper, we assess whether the X-ray AGN population origin for TeV neutrinos can be tested by using the spatial correlation between the neutrino population and X-ray AGN population with future neutrino telescopes. By performing simulations, we find that, the AGN origin of the neutrino background above 100\\,TeV can be tested at a confidence level of $\\sim2.4σ$ with five-year observations of IceCube-Gen2, which has an angular resolution of $\\sim0.2$ degree. With better angular resolution and sensitivity in the energy range of above $300$\\,TeV, a 30-${\\rm km^3}$ underwater neutrino telescope, such as High-energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope (HUNT), is expected to reach a significance of $\\sim8.6σ$ in testing the association after five years of exposure."}

The resulting metric function is asymptotically Schwarzschild but carries a characteristic Q^3/(9ξ^2 r^4) correction, where $Q$ is the magnetic charge and $ξ$ is the nonlinear electrodynamics parameter, with the conventional Reissner-Nordström term Q^2/r^2 absent. We analyze the horizon structure and construct three-dimensional embedding diagrams to visualize spatial geometry. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we compute the weak-field deflection angle in vacuum, cold plasma, and axion-plasmon media, finding that the nonlinear electromagnetic corrections reduce the total bending compared to Schwarzschild at fixed Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass. The gravitational redshift, Joule-Thomson expansion coefficient, and heat capacity are derived, revealing phase transitions and inversion curves that depend on the model parameters. We obtain closed-form expressions for the photon sphere radius, Lyapunov exponent, and shadow size, demonstrating their sensitivity to Q and $ξ$ along observable Intensities. Fully relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion show that the confining geometry produces a $\\sim 40\\%$ enhancement in mass accretion rate relative to Schwarzschild and generates quasi-periodic oscillations with stable 3:2 and 2:1 frequency ratios matching observations from black hole X-ray binaries. These results establish the confining nonlinear electrodynamics black hole as a testable model that can reproduce high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation pairs without invoking black hole spin."}

Permitting explicit first-order phase transitions allows us to systematically search for twin-star solutions, i.e. the existence of stars degenerate in mass but differing in radius. We find that current observational constraints exclude all but two classes of twin stars. The first is characterized by a first-order transition occurring at a very low density, where the material properties of the system either stay largely intact or move away from the conformal limit. In the second, more interesting class, the discontinuity in the mass-radius curve emerges after a rapid crossover transition at a significantly higher density, with the speed of sound exhibiting two sharp peaks at distinct densities. Since neither class shows clear conformalization upon entering the second branch, the standard twin-star scenario linking the mass-radius discontinuity to deconfinement can be firmly ruled out, while even the remaining solutions -- disfavored by per-mille Bayes factors and in tension with theoretical bounds -- are likely to be excluded in the future."}
