Its relatively soft $γ$-ray spectrum peaks near 500~MeV, and since 2020 it has undergone an exceptional series of flaring episodes. The observed emission is well described by synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models, with negligible contribution from external seed photons. We investigate the physical origin of BL~Lacertae's $γ$-ray temporal and spectral variability using data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the \\textit{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope, and show that this variability can be explained by a single varying parameter, namely the electrons' peak energy, $γ_p$, under a single-zone SSC scenario with a log-parabolic electron distribution. We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo to estimate the spectral parameters of BL Lacertae over time, selected from an adaptive-binned gamma-ray light curve. We then study the correlation between the inverse Compton peak luminosity, $L_{IC}$, and the position of this peak on the SED energy axis, $E_p$, and compare it with what is expected for a single-zone SSC scenario when only one parameter is free to vary. We find a correlation $L_{IC} = 10^{42.33\\pm0.15\\pm0.18_{sys}}E_p^{0.98\\pm0.05\\pm0.06_{sys}}$, consistent, within the errors, with the linear relation $L_{\\mathrm{IC}} \\propto E_p$, expected when $γ_p$ is the only free parameter in the assumed SSC model. This result supports a minimalist SSC scenario in which changes in $γ_p$ dominate the observed temporal and spectral variability of BL~Lacertae."}

The frequency and ubiquity of these components in silicon and calcium features specifically indicates that the mechanism through which they form must be common occurrence among the majority of SNe Ia. Here we present modelling of the HVF evolution in a sample of six well observed SNe Ia with the radiative-transfer code tardis. A base model is derived for each of the SNe to reproduce the photospheric velocity components, followed by a grid of simulations with Gaussian enhancements to the density profile at high velocities. We train a set of neural networks to emulate the impact of these density enhancements upon the simulated silicon line profile. These networks are subsequently used within a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to infer the density enhancement parameters that most closely reproduce the HVF evolution. While we obtain good matches for the silicon profile, we find that a single density enhancement alone cannot simultaneously produce the observed silicon and calcium HVF evolution. Our findings indicate that neither the delayed-detonation mechanism, nor the double-detonation mechanism can produce these HVFs, suggesting that something may be missing from the models."}

Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "Searches for the putative large-scale X-ray halo around the Geminga pulsar have been extensively performed using various narrow field-of-view X-ray telescopes. In this paper, we present wide-field scanning observation of Geminga with SRG/ART-XC. Our X-ray analysis provides, for the first time, direct imaging of a $3.5^\\circ \\times 3.5^\\circ$ region in the $4-12$ keV energy band, comparable in extent to the expected Geminga emission. The ART-XC observation provides a highly uniform sky coverage without strong vignetting effects. The synchrotron X-ray halo flux was predicted using a physical model based on particle injection, diffusion, and cooling over the pulsar's lifetime, as well as the spectral and spatial properties of the synchrotron X-ray and inverse-Compton gamma-ray emissions. The model is tuned to reproduce existing multiwavelength data from X-ray upper limits and GeV to TeV gamma-ray observations. After accounting for the high particle background and its uncertainties, no significant emission is found in the assumed source region, and X-ray flux upper limits are derived. These limits are less constraining by up to a factor of three with respect to existing results obtained with narrow field-of-view telescopes and longer exposure times. Nonetheless, we place direct and independent constraints on Geminga's ambient magnetic field strength, which are compatible with other studies. Our methodology, including simulation for longer observation times, is applied for the first time to the wide field-of-view search for pulsar halos. Using extensive simulations, we also show that a 68% probability of detecting the Geminga pulsar halo can be achieved with a 20-day SRG/ART-XC exposure for a 3 $μG$ magnetic field."}

Numerous classical novae have been observed to emit γ-rays (E > 100 MeV) detected by the Fermi-LAT. The prevailing hypothesis attributes this emission to the interaction of accelerated particles within shocks in the nova ejecta. However, the lack of non-thermal X-ray detection coincident with the γ-rays remains a challenge to this theory. Methods. We performed similar analyses of the Fermi-LAT data for both novae to determine the duration, localization, and spectral properties of the γ-ray emission. These results were compared with optical data from the AAVSO database and X-ray observations from NuSTAR, available for V1723 Sco 2024 only, to infer the nature of the accelerated particles. Finally, we used a physical emission model to extract key parameters related to particle acceleration. Results. V1723 Sco 2024 was found to be a very bright γ-ray source with an emission duration of 15 days allowing us to constrain the spectral index and the total energy of accelerated protons. Despite early NuSTAR observations, no non-thermal X-ray emission was detected simultaneously with the γ-rays. However, unexpected γ-ray and thermal hard X-ray emission were observed more than 40 days after the nova outburst, suggesting that particle acceleration can occur even several weeks post-eruption. V6598 Sgr 2023, on the other hand, was detected by the Fermi-LAT at a significance level of 4σover just two days, one of the shortest γ-ray emission durations ever recorded, coinciding with a rapid decline in optical brightness. Finally, the high ratio of γ-ray to optical luminosities and γ-ray to X-ray luminosities for both novae, as well as the curvature of the γ-ray spectrum of V1723 Sco below 500 MeV, are all more consistent with the hadronic than the leptonic scenario for γ-ray generation in novae."}

Pacholski", "Sandro Mereghetti", "Martin Topinka"], "title": "INTEGRAL IBIS catalog of magnetar bursts", "comment": "17 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables. Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "One of the distinctive properties of magnetars, young neutron stars powered mainly by magnetic energy, is the emission of short ($\\lesssim$1 s) bursts of hard X-rays. Such bursts have been observed in nearly all the known magnetars, although at different and time-variable rates of occurrence. In the last two decades, the INTEGRAL satellite has extensively covered with good imaging capabilities the Galactic plane, where most magnetars reside. We present the results of a comprehensive search for magnetar bursts in more than twenty years of archival data of the INTEGRAL IBIS instrument (15 keV - 1 MeV). This led to the detection of 1349 bursts with 30-150 keV fluence in the $\\sim2\\times10^{-9} - 3\\times10^{-6}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ range from 21 of the 34 examined magnetars and candidate magnetars with well known positions. The durations of the bursts, in terms of $T_{90}$, follow a lognormal distribution centered at $\\sim0.1$ s. Most of the detected bursts originated from three particularly active sources: 1E 1547-5408, SGR 1806-20, and SGR 1935+2154. The integral distributions of their burst fluences follow power laws with slopes $β$= 0.76$\\pm$0.04, 0.95$\\pm$0.06, and 0.92$\\pm$0.10, respectively. The burst spectra are generally well fit with an exponentially cut-off power law with peak energy $E_{peak}$ in the range $\\sim20-60$ keV for SGR 1806-20 and SGR 1935+2154, while the bursts of 1E 1547-5408 are slightly harder ($E_{peak}\\sim35-100$ keV). A significant anti-correlation between $E_{peak}$ and fluence is found for SGR 1806-20, which provided the largest number of bursts among the sources of our sample."}

The physical origin of their emission and the blazar sequence remain open questions. We present a self-consistent two-zone leptonic model in which relativistic electrons accelerate in a compact region, losing energy via synchrotron and inverse Compton processes, and escape into a larger zone permeated by an external photon field associated with magnetohydrodynamic winds from the accretion disk. By varying only the mass accretion rate onto the central black hole, the model naturally reproduces the blazar sequence, including Compton Dominance, $γ$-ray spectral indices, and the positions of synchrotron and inverse Compton peaks, while variations in secondary parameters account for the observed spread in the data. Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars exhibit strong external Compton emission from the extended zone, whereas BL Lac objects are dominated by synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission from the compact acceleration region. This framework highlights the key role of accretion rate and spatially structured emission zones in shaping blazar spectra and provides a unified interpretation of their diverse phenomenology."}

Over more than 20 years of operation, the Pierre Auger Observatory has delivered invaluable insights into the modeling of hadronic interactions at energies beyond human-made particle accelerators. Notably, predictions from current models of hadronic interactions yield a muon deficit that becomes more pronounced with energy when compared to measurements. Presently, the interpretation of the nuclear mass composition estimated from the muon content is in tension with that from direct measurements of the depth of the maximum of electromagnetic profiles. Yet, the measured fluctuations of the muon content of air showers are in agreement with model predictions. These findings hint at small deviations in hadronic models that accumulate throughout the whole shower development rather than at large errors in the calculation of the first hadronic interactions. Also, in an independent, data-driven analysis, we show that the muon deficit can be alleviated if we allow a shift of the predicted depth of the maximum of air-shower profiles by 30 -50 g cm$^{-2}$ towards a heavier mass composition. More recently, we have also provided an updated measurement of the proton-proton cross-section at a center-of-mass energy of 57 TeV and the first estimates of the neutron content of air showers by exploiting late-time signals from the surface scintillator detectors of AugerPrime, the present upgrade of the Observatory. With the advent of AugerPrime, we expect to deliver breakthrough results on the 100 TeV-scale hadronic interactions in the next decade."}
