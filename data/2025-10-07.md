Abstract: Multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astrophysics have experienced rapid
growth over the past decade, seeking a complete picture of different cosmic
phenomena. Transient sources, in particular, benefit from the input of
multi-messenger observations, offering complementary perspectives on the same
event while maximizing the detection probability of a rapidly fading signal. In
this context, Gravitational Wave (GW) detections serve as perfect triggers for
potential counterpart detections. Notably, a GW alert could be associated with
a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB), jetted cataclysmic events produced either by the
collision of a binary neutron star system or a core-collapse supernova. These
sources also radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing detection by
X- and gamma-ray instruments aboard various satellites and thus enabling
multi-wavelength triggering opportunities. The strong interest in minimizing
reaction time to capture the full-time evolution of the emission, together with
the often challenging localization uncertainties of the alerts, underscores the
need for rapid and well-coordinated follow-up programs such as the one
developed by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration.
  This contribution will give an overview of the transient follow-up strategy
carried out by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration, from the external alert trigger and
the automatic reaction of the observatory to the various analysis steps of the
obtained observations. To illustrate this comprehensive strategy, we will show
two examples of follow-up observations of both GRBs and GWs, highlighting key
results and challenges in the search for an associated high-energy gamma-ray
emission.

### [2] [Medium-scale anisotropies measured by Telescope Array surface detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02739)
*Jihyun Kim,Dmitri Ivanov,Kazumasa Kawata,Hiroyuki Sagawa,Gordon Thomson*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The TA experiment has found two medium-scale anisotropies: the TA Hotspot near Ursa Major and an excess towards the Perseus-Pisces supercluster, suggesting potential origins for ultra-high energy cosmic rays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the origins of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is critical for astrophysics, as these particles can reveal information about the most energetic processes in the universe.

Method: Oversampling analysis of TA surface detector data was conducted to evaluate medium-scale event excesses.

Result: The presentation will present the latest findings on the TA Hotspot and the Perseus-Pisces supercluster excess, including evidence for potential anisotropies.

Conclusion: These anisotropies may indicate sources of UHECRs, and further analysis is needed to determine their exact origins.

Abstract: The Telescope Array (TA) experiment, the largest observatory for ultra-high
energy cosmic rays in the Northern Hemisphere, has identified two medium-scale
anisotropies: the TA Hotspot near the constellation Ursa Major and an excess in
the direction of the Perseus-Pisces supercluster. Studying these medium-scale
anisotropies may provide insights into the origins of ultra-high energy cosmic
rays. This presentation will explore an oversampling analysis of TA surface
detector data to evaluate these medium-scale event excesses and will present
the latest findings on the TA Hotspot and the Perseus-Pisces supercluster
excess.

Abstract: Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are extremely energetic charged
particles that originate from outer space. The Telescope Array (TA) experiment,
the largest UHECR observatory in the Northern Hemisphere, has provided
high-precision measurements of the cosmic ray energy spectrum due to its stable
operation and efficient data collection. These measurements have revealed three
significant spectral features: the ankle, shoulder, and cutoff. Analyzing these
features is crucial for understanding the origin and propagation of UHECRs. In
this talk, we will present the latest energy spectrum measured by the TA
surface detectors and discuss the observed differences in the UHECR energy
spectrum between the northern and southern skies.

Abstract: Supernova (SN) explosions interacting with dense circumstellar medium are
considered to be very promising sites for efficient cosmic-ray (CR)
acceleration and subsequent emission of neutral-pion-decay gamma rays. These
environments share similarities with already detected gamma-ray novae, but with
much greater available energy content, so it is important to characterize their
emission in the very-high-energy range. We present the results of H.E.S.S.
observations of one such candidate source - SN 2024ggi, located in NGC 3621 at
a distance of 7.24 Mpc. A total of 30 hours of data, gathered throughout a
month of post-explosion observations, provide flux upper limits that are used
to constrain source parameters, offering meaningful insights for theoretical
predictions. We exclude bright gamma-ray emission in the first day after
explosion, and later upper limits are consistent with wind densities derived
from optical observations.

TL;DR: 科学家首次在南半球发现中年脉冲星B1055$-52的TeV伽马射线晕，扩展了现有脉冲星晕的理解。


<details>

Motivation: 脉冲星晕为研究脉冲星系统演化及高能粒子传播提供了独特的机会，但此前仅发现少数此类源，因此每个新发现都对理解整体脉冲星晕特性至关重要。

Method: 利用H.E.S.S.阵列的观测数据，在0.3至60 TeV能量范围内分析B1055$-52脉冲星周围的扩展非常高的能量γ射线发射。

Result: 观测显示γ射线发射扩展范围达(2.05 ± 0.32)°，超出H.E.S.S.观测区域，且在整个发射范围内未发现显著的光谱变化。

Conclusion: 此次发现表明慢扩散可能是脉冲星晕的共同特性，同时为研究脉冲星晕的群体特性、其对宇宙射线传播的影响以及作为银河电子和正电子源的作用提供了重要数据点。

Abstract: Pulsar halos are a recently identified class of TeV $\gamma$-ray sources,
offering valuable insights into the evolution of pulsar systems at the highest
energies. However, only a handful of such sources have been detected so far,
making each new identification critical for understanding the properties of the
population as a whole. We report the first detection of extended
very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray emission around PSR~B1055$-$52 using
observations from the H.E.S.S. array. This middle-aged pulsar, previously
grouped together with Geminga and PSR~B0656$+$14 as part of the ``Three
Musketeers'', has now been confirmed to host a TeV pulsar halo, making it the
third detected system of its kind, and the first TeV pulsar halo discovered in
the southern hemisphere. Our analysis performed in an energy range of
$0.3-60\,$TeV, reveals gamma-ray emission with a one sigma extension of $(2.05
\pm 0.32)^\circ$. The analysis indicates that the emission extends beyond the
region which was observed with H.E.S.S.. No significant spectral variation is
detected across the emission.
  The diffusion coefficient derived for this halo is significantly lower than
the standard ISM value, aligning with findings in the Geminga halo and
indicating that slow diffusion may be a common property of pulsar halos. The
detection of this new TeV pulsar halo provides a crucial data point for
studying the population-wide properties of pulsar halos, their impact on
cosmic-ray propagation, and their role as a source of Galactic electrons and
positrons.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the last few years, a few supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have shown
short-term (of the order of hours) X-ray variability. Given the limited size of
the sample, every new addition to this class of SMBHs can bring invaluable
information. Within the context of an automated search for X-ray sources
showing flux variability in the \textit{Chandra} archive, we identified
peculiar variability patterns in 2MASX J12571076+2724177 (J1257), a SMBH in the
Coma cluster, during observations performed in 2020. We investigated the
long-term evolution of the flux, together with the evolution of the spectral
parameters throughout the \textit{Chandra} and \textit{XMM-Newton}
observations, which cover a time span of approximately 20 years. We found that
J1257 has repeatedly shown peculiar variability over the last 20 years, on
typical timescales of $\simeq20-25$ ks. From our spectral analysis, we found
hints of a softer-when-brighter behaviour and of two well-separated flux
states. We suggest that J1257 might represent a new addition to the
ever-growing size of relatively low mass SMBHs
($M\simeq10^6-10^7\mathrm{M}_\odot$) showing extreme, possibly quasi-periodic
X-ray variability on short time scales. The available dataset does not allow
for a definitive classification of the nature of the variability. However,
given the observed properties, it could either represent a quasi-periodic
oscillation at particularly low frequency or be associated with quasi-periodic
eruptions in an AGN with peculiar spectral properties.

Abstract: We analysed the flickering of selected nova-like cataclysmic variables
observed by the TESS satellite and XMM-Newton. We searched for break
frequencies ($f_{\rm b}$) in the corresponding power density spectra (PDS), and
for any long-term evolution. We found a new optical $f_{\rm b}$ in three
nova-like systems and confirmed that the value of this frequency is clustered
around 1 mHz. V504 Cen and V751 Cyg show possible X-ray counterparts of $f_{\rm
b}$ that had previously only been seen in MV Lyr. This points towards the very
central disc for source localisation. We investigated a previously proposed
correlation between white dwarf mass and $f_{\rm b}$, but thanks to the new
measurements we do not conclude its existence. V3885 Sgr and V1193 Ori show
flaring activity in the long-term light curve during which TESS observations
were made. The corresponding PDSs show changes in shape and disappearance of
$f_{\rm b}$. TT Ari and SGRt 062340.2-265715 exhibit smooth changes in the
long-term optical light curve, and the corresponding TESS observations show
variable $f_{\rm b}$ during these changes. $f_{\rm b}$ is higher for lower
brightness, which was seen only in MV Lyr so far.

### [8] [Analysis of the Supernova Remnant IC 443 using H.E.S.S. Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02843)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents the first analysis of IC 443's very-high-energy gamma-ray emission observed by H.E.S.S., supporting a hadronic origin of the emission and highlighting the role of relativistic protons interacting with the molecular cloud.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the mechanisms of cosmic-ray acceleration and gamma-ray production in supernova remnants, especially IC 443 as a potential source of PeV cosmic rays.

Method: Observations using H.E.S.S. combined with multi-wavelength data from Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, and VERITAS for comparison.

Result: Extended very-high-energy gamma-ray emission was detected from IC 443, consistent across different observatories. Multi-wavelength analysis supports a hadronic origin, indicating relativistic protons interacting with the molecular cloud.

Conclusion: IC 443 serves as a key laboratory for studying cosmic-ray acceleration mechanisms and their interactions with surrounding mediums, reinforcing its significance in high-energy astrophysics.

Abstract: IC 443 is a well-known supernova remnant that stands out due to its
interaction with a dense molecular cloud, creating a complex environment where
shocks can efficiently accelerate particles to high energies. This makes it a
key target for investigating the mechanisms of cosmic-ray acceleration and
gamma-ray production, particularly in the context of supernova remnants as
potential sources of PeV cosmic rays. This work presents a first analysis of
the region as observed by H.E.S.S.. We detect extended very-high-energy
gamma-ray emission from IC 443, consistent with previous observations by
VERITAS and MAGIC. A multi-wavelength comparison incorporating data from
Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, and VERITAS strongly supports a hadronic origin of the
observed emission, and highlights the presence of relativistic protons
interacting with the surrounding molecular cloud. These findings reinforce the
role of IC 443 as a key laboratory for studying supernova remnants as
cosmic-ray accelerators and their interaction with their surrounding mediums.

TL;DR: 研究者观测了一个潮汐破坏事件（TDE）XMMSL2 J1404-2511，发现其X射线辐射从热态（kT~80 eV）转变为由温暖的厚冕主导的更硬状态，X射线亮度在230天内快速衰减500倍，推测该事件源于部分剥离的恒星而非完全的恒星破坏，并通过后续的SRG/eROSITA全天空巡天观测到两次重新变亮的事件加以支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者希望通过观测TDE的X射线变化，理解潮汐破坏事件中恒星与黑洞相互作用的物理机制，以及不同观测手段在不同波段对这类事件的探测效率。

Method: 研究团队利用XMM-Newton望远镜的X射线监测数据，追踪了XMMSL2 J1404-2511在X射线波段的辐射变化，并结合SRG/eROSITA的全天空巡天数据进行后续观测分析，以研究TDE的演化特征。

Result: 观测显示X射线辐射在7天内由热态转变为硬态，随后在230天内快速衰减500倍；光学/紫外光变曲线保持平坦，亮度约为$2	imes10^{41}$ ergs/s；X射线样本中TDEs具有冕的事件比例高于光学选择样本。

Conclusion: X射线辐射快衰减可能表明该事件是部分剥离的恒星导致，而非完全的恒星破坏；需要进一步的光学样本长期监测以确认TDEs的这种特性是内在的还是选择效应造成的。

Abstract: We report here on observations of a tidal disruption event, XMMSL2
J1404-2511, discovered in an XMM-Newton slew, in a quiescent galaxy at z=0.043.
X-ray monitoring covered the epoch when the accretion disc transitioned from a
thermal state, with kT~80 eV, to a harder state dominated by a warm,
optically-thick corona. The bulk of the coronal formation took place within 7
days and was coincident with a temporary drop in the emitted radiation by a
factor 4. After a plateau phase of ~100 days, the X-ray flux of XMMSL2
J1404-2511 decayed by a factor 500 within 230 days. We estimate the black hole
mass in the galaxy to be $M_{BH}=4\pm{2}\times10^{6}$ solar masses and the peak
X-ray luminosity $L_{X}\sim6\times10^{43}$ ergs/s. The optical/UV light curve
is flat over the timescale of the observations with $L_{opt}\sim
2\times10^{41}$ ergs/s. We find that TDEs with coronae are more often found in
an X-ray sample than in an optically-selected sample. Late-time monitoring of
the optical sample is needed to test whether this is an intrinsic property of
TDEs or is due to a selection effect. From the fast decay of the X-ray emission
we consider that the event was likely due to the partial stripping of an
evolved star rather than a full stellar disruption, an idea supported by the
detection of two further re-brightening episodes, two and four years after the
first event, in the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey.

TL;DR: 研究利用印度首颗X射线偏振卫星XPoSat上的XSPECT载荷，首次在低能带研究了Scorpius X-1的光谱和时间特性，特别是在其水平、正常和爆发分支期间的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scorpius X-1是天空中最强的X射线源，过去在低能波段研究它很困难，但新型仪器XSPECT提供了研究能力。

Method: 使用XSPECT仪器对Scorpius X-1的光谱和时间特性进行观测，并分析其在不同分支（水平、正常和爆发）上的变化。

Result: 发现在爆发分支期间，Compton化通量和盘通量显著升高，同时中子星黑体温度和内盘温度也上升。观察到铁K alpha和铁K beta线的存在，以及Z-轨迹由冠层光学深度、Compton化通量和盘通量的变化驱动。

Conclusion: 这些结果有助于理解Scorpius X-1在不同活动状态下的物理机制，并揭示了其高能谱特性与准周期振荡之间的可能联系。

Abstract: Scorpius X-1 is the brightest and first discovered X-ray source in the sky.
Studying this source in the low-energy band has been challenging in the past
due to its high brightness. However, with the X-ray SPECtroscopy and Timing
(XSPECT) payload on-board Indias first X-ray Polarimetry Satellite (XPoSat), we
have the capability to study the source despite its very high brightness,
thanks to the fast (1 ms) readout of the instrument. We investigate the
evolution of the spectral and timing properties of Sco X-1 across the
horizontal, normal, and flaring branch, as observed with XSPECT. We examine
changes in the spectral parameters as a function of position on the color-color
diagram (CCD). Spectral studies indicate that the soft X-ray emission can be
modeled using a multicolor disk component, with the inner disk temperature
ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 keV. The hard component is described by a Comptonized
continuum using either the nthComp or Comptb model with electron temperatures
from 2.4 to 4.7 keV and optical depth between 5 and 14. Additionally, we
observe the presence of an iron K-alpha line at 6.6 keV and an iron K-beta line
at 7.6 keV. Both spectral models suggest a steep rise in Comptonization flux as
well as disk flux in the flaring branch. An increase in neutron star blackbody
temperature and inner disk temperature are also observed during flaring. The
Z-track is driven by changes in the optical depth of the corona, the
Comptonization flux and the disk flux and the inner disk temperature. No
quasi-periodic oscillations are detected in any branch, suggesting their
association with the high-energy spectrum.

Abstract: The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, with energies $E \geq 10^{18}$
eV, remains unknown. Among the key observables used to investigate their nature
are the energy spectrum, the arrival direction distribution, and the
composition as a function of energy. The composition of the primary cosmic ray
is inferred from properties of the extensive air showers they initiate,
particularly from parameters sensitive to the primary mass. The most sensitive
parameters to the primary mass are the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum,
typically measured with fluorescence telescopes, and the muon content of the
shower, measured using dedicated muon detectors. A commonly used observable in
composition studies is the muon density at a fixed distance from the shower
axis, derived by evaluating the reconstructed muon lateral distribution
function (MLDF) at a reference distance. A specific type of muon detector
features two acquisition modes: binary and integrator (commonly referred to as
ADC mode, for Analog-to-Digital Converter). The binary mode allows for direct
muon counting, while the ADC mode infers the muon number from the integrated
signal of the detector response. Existing methods reconstruct the MLDF using
data from either acquisition mode individually, or by combining both, but
usually assigning a single mode per detector station in a given event. This
work presents a novel method to reconstruct the MLDF based on a likelihood
approach that simultaneously incorporates data from both acquisition modes at
each detector station. We apply our method to the underground muon detectors of
the Pierre Auger Observatory as a case study. However, this general approach
can be applied to future detectors with dual acquisition capabilities. Our
results demonstrate that the combined method outperforms traditional techniques
that rely solely on either binary or ADC mode data.

Abstract: Intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), with masses ranging from a hundred and
a million solar masses, are hypothesised to be surrounded by dense regions of
dark matter known as dark matter spikes, where the annihilation of dark matter
particles could produce detectable gamma rays. The detection of dark matter
annihilation around IMBHs therefore offers a promising approach for probing the
nature of dark matter. In this work, we search for dark matter annihilation
around IMBHs using data from the Galactic Plane Survey, the Extragalactic
Survey and a selection of satellite galaxies observed by the H.E.S.S. gamma-ray
experiment in Namibia. Since no evidence for a gamma-ray signal from dark
matter annihilation around IMBHs has been found, we set upper limits on the
velocity-weighted annihilation cross section for dark matter masses between 800
GeV and 100 TeV. Our analysis obtains limits on the velocity-weighted
annihilation cross section below the thermal relic cross section for dark
matter masses between 10 and 100 TeV.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分早期的Be星（称为gamma Cas星）表现出异常强烈的热X射线辐射，这可能来自白矮星伴星吸积或磁性相互作用。理解这些现象对揭示这些恒星系统的物理机制至关重要。

Method: 利用高分辨率X射线光谱学，将观测到的荧光Fe Kalpha发射线与磁性相互作用和吸积WD两种情景的合成谱线进行比较，进一步区分非磁性与磁性WD的吸积情况。

Result: 非磁性吸积WD模型中，Fe Kalpha复合谱线非常宽，达140 eV；而磁性星-盘相互作用及磁性吸积WD模型中谱线宽度约40 eV。磁性相互作用中，谱线中心随Be星轨道移动，吸积WD模型中则随WD移动。

Conclusion: 未来高分辨率X射线观测将有助于区分这些假说，特别是Resolve光谱仪在XRISM上的应用能够显著提升gamma Cas星的X射线辐射源识别能力。

Abstract: About 12 percent of the early-type Be stars, so-called gamma Cas stars,
exhibit an unusually hard and bright thermal X-ray emission that could result
from accretion onto a white dwarf companion or from magnetic interactions
between the Be star and its decretion disk. Exploring the full power of
high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of gamma Cas stars requires comparison of
observations of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines near 6.4 keV with
synthetic profiles of this line complex computed in the framework of the
magnetic interaction and the accreting WD scenarios. For the latter, we further
distinguish between accretion onto a non-magnetic and a magnetic WD. Our models
account for different reservoirs of reprocessing material: the Be circumstellar
decretion disk, the Be photosphere, an accretion disk around the WD companion,
a magnetically channelled accretion flow and the WD photosphere. We find
considerably different line properties for the different scenarios. For a
non-magnetic accreting WD, the global Fe Kalpha complex is extremely broad,
reaching a full width of 140 eV, whilst it is ~ 40 eV for the magnetic
star-disk interaction and the magnetic accreting WD cases. In the magnetic
star-disk interaction, the line centroid follows the orbital motion of the Be
star, whereas it moves along with the WD in the case of an accreting WD. For
gamma Cas, given the 15 times larger amplitude of the WD orbital motion, the
shift in position for an accreting WD should be easily detectable with
high-resolution spectrographs such as Resolve on XRISM, but remains essentially
undetectable for the magnetic star-disk interaction. Upcoming high-resolution
spectroscopy of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines in the X-ray spectra
of gamma Cas stars will thus allow to distinguish between the competing
scenarios.

Abstract: The theory of cosmic-ray (CR) penetration into dense molecular clouds
developed recently for relativistic particles by Chernyshov et al. (2024) is
extended to non-relativistic CRs. Interstellar CRs streaming into the clouds
are able to resonantly excite MHD waves in diffuse cloud envelopes. This leads
to the self-modulation, such that streaming particles are scattered at the
self-generated waves. In contrast to relativistic CRs, transport of
lower-energy particles in the envelopes is generally heavily affected by
ionization losses; furthermore, both CR protons and electrons contribute to
wave excitation. We show that these effects have profound impact on the
self-modulation, and can dramatically reduce CR spectra even for clouds with
moderate column densities of a few times $10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$.

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are Galactic-scale nanohertz-frequency
gravitational wave (GW) detectors. Recently, several PTAs have found evidence
for the presence of GWs in their datasets, but none of them have achieved a
community-defined definitive (> 5$\sigma$) detection. Here, we identify
limiting noise sources for PTAs and quantify their impact on sensitivity to GWs
under different observing and noise modelling strategies. First, we search for
intrinsic pulse jitter in a sample of 89 MSPs observed by the MeerKAT Pulsar
Timing Array and obtain new jitter measurements for 20 MSPs. We then forecast
jitter noise in pulsars for the future SKA-Mid telescope, finding that the
timing precision of many of the best-timed MSPs would be dominated by jitter
noise. We then consider dispersion measure variations from the interstellar
medium and find that their effects are best mitigated by modelling them as a
stationary Gaussian process with a power-law spectrum. Improving upon the
established hasasia code for PTA sensitivity analysis, we assess the timing
potential of the lower frequency UHF-band (544$-$1088\,MHz) of MeerKAT and find
a potential increase in GW background sensitivity by $\approx 8$\%, relative to
observing at L-band. We show that this improvement relies on assumptions on the
propagation through the interstellar medium, and highlight that if observing
frequency-dependent propagation effects, such as scattering noise, are present,
where noise is not completely correlated across observing frequency, then the
improvement is significantly diminished. Using the multi-frequency receivers
and sub-arraying flexibility of MeerKAT, we find that focussed, high-cadence
observations of the best MSPs can enhance the sensitivity of the array for both
the continuous GWs and stochastic GWB. These results highlight the role of
MeerKAT and the MPTA in the context of international GW search efforts.

Abstract: The Virgo Cluster is the nearest cool core cluster that features two
well-studied sloshing cold fronts at radii of $r \approx 30$ kpc and $r \approx
90$ kpc, respectively. In this work, we present results of XMM-Newton mosaic
observations of a third, southwestern, cold front at a radius of $r \approx
250$ kpc, originally discovered with Suzaku. All three cold fronts are likely
to be parts of an enormous swirling pattern, rooted in the core. The comparison
with a numerical simulation of a binary cluster merger indicates that these
cold fronts were produced in the same single event $-$ likely the infall of M49
from the northwest of Virgo and it is now re-entering the cluster from the
south. This outermost cold front has probably survived for $2-3$ Gyr since the
disturbance. We identified single sharp edges in the surface brightness
profiles of the southern and southwestern sections of the cold front, whereas
the western section is better characterized with double edges. This implies
that magnetic fields have preserved the leading edge of the cold front, while
its western side is beginning to split into two cold fronts likely due to
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The slopes of the 2D power spectrum of the
X-ray surface brightness fluctuations, derived for the brighter side of the
cold front, are consistent with the expectation from Kolmogorov turbulence. Our
findings highlight the role of cold fronts in shaping the thermal dynamics of
the intracluster medium beyond the cluster core, which has important
implications for cluster cosmology. Next-generation X-ray observatories, such
as the proposed AXIS mission, will be ideal for identifying and characterizing
ancient cold fronts.

Abstract: Pulsar halos are a class of extended very-high-energy (VHE) sources
highlighted by the HAWC observatory towards the Geminga pulsar and PSR
B0656$+$14. These VHE sources are interpreted as the inverse Compton emission
from electrons and positrons diffusing in the interstellar medium at an
inhibited rate, having escaped the pulsar wind nebula. Our aim is to search for
new pulsar halos using H.E.S.S. data and to constrain their physical
properties. Using a physically-motivated model of pulsar halos, we created
template-based models of the spatial and energetic distributions of the
expected gamma-ray emission using the Gammapy library. A promising candidate
source to which this model can be effectively applied is HESS J1831$-$098, an
extended VHE source spatially coincident with two energetic pulsars, which also
exhibits spectral continuity and morphological compatibility with the
ultra-high-energy source 1LHAASO J1831$-$1007u*. It could be powered by the
radio pulsar PSR J1831$-$0952 with a characteristic age of 128 kyr. We present
a spectro-morphological analysis of this source with H.E.S.S. data, revealing
that the emission is well described with a pulsar halo model, although we
cannot reject a simple 2D Gaussian morphology. We discuss the implication of
the derived physical parameters of the model.
