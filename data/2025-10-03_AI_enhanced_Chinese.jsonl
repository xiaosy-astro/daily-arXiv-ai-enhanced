At a redshift $z=0.161$, it was detected by MAGIC\ntelescopes approximately four hours since the trigger. VHE dataset was complied\nwith the datasets of other wavelengths in between the timescale of 1.7 to 4\nhours to construct the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). In\nprevious studies of GRB~160821B, synchrotron and external Compton (EC) model\ncould explain the VHE emission better than the synchrotron and synchrotron\nself-Compton (SSC) model. Although, these fits were mostly eyeballing data\nwithout any optimisation. Our model includes the combination of synchrotron,\nSSC, and EC models with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Our\nanalysis reveals that the EC contribution is negligible in comparison with the\nSSC and our model explains the VHE data well for the wind medium. We found that\nGRB~160821B is the least energetic VHE GRB and it occurred in high density wind\nmedium which is quiet unusual for a short GRB. But like other long-duration VHE\nGRBs, GRB~160821B occurred in a poorly magnetised medium. As there is no\nstatistical study on afterglow modelling of short GRB sample, we compare the\ninferred properties of GRB~160821B with other VHE GRBs. It stands out\ndistinctively in the $E_{k, \\rm iso}$ - $\\epsilon_B$ parameter space and lies\noutside the 3-$\\sigma$ region of the correlation.

At a redshift of $z = 0.409$ and magnified by a\nfactor of $\\sim$68, extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations have\nbeen obtained. The explosion mechanism producing this rare event and\ndifferences compared to lower redshift supernovae however have not been\nexplored in detail. Here we compare observations of iPTF16geu to existing\nradiative transfer simulations of type Ia supernova explosion models selected\nfrom the literature. We find that overall the DDC6 and PDDEL1 models, specific\nvariations of the delayed detonation explosion scenario, produce the closest\nmatch to the light curves and many absorption features, but struggle to\nreplicate the observed colours and in particular the rest-frame UV. We also\ninvestigate the magnification and reddening values required to improve\nagreement with the selected models. We find some evidence in favour of a UV\nflux excess that may be intrinsic to iPTF16geu or due to external factors such\nas host galaxy subtraction and uncertainties in the reddening law. Upcoming\nsurveys will significantly increase the samples of SNe discovered at high\nredshifts due to strong gravitational lensing. These glSNe will enable tighter\nconstraints on the explosion physics of type Ia supernovae and how this has\nevolved throughout the Universe.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, the interpretation of early DSNB data will face\nsignificant challenges due to degeneracies between astrophysical parameters and\nuncertainties in supernova neutrino modeling. We explore how complementary\nastronomical observations can break these degeneracies and, in this context, we\ninvestigate whether early DSNB observations can constrain invisible supernovae,\nwhich have no optical emission but are powerful neutrino sources before being\nswallowed by a forming black hole. Leveraging the differences in the spectra\nbetween invisible and visible supernovae, we estimate the sensitivity of 1)\ndetecting the existence of invisible supernovae, and 2) determining the\nfraction of invisible supernovae.
