In this Letter, we present the first relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a surface shear-driven magnetar eruption, capturing reconnection-driven plasma heating, the ejection of relativistically hot plasma, and the formation of a hot fireball confined within the inner magnetosphere. We find that magnetic reconnection in the equatorial current sheet launches a hot trailing outflow capable of powering the initial spike observed in giant flares, while simultaneously leaving behind a thermally stratified fireball with sufficient thermal energy to produce the pulsating, decaying tail. Together, these features provide a self-consistent physical framework for understanding the observed energetics of magnetar giant flares. The eruption also expels a magnetically dominated giant plasmoid carrying up to $\\sim 9\\%$ of the magnetosphere's total magnetic energy. Furthermore, our simulation demonstrates how the plasmoid drives the formation of a blast wave -- an important ingredient in models linking magnetar eruptions to fast radio bursts."}

Appendices add 21 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables", "summary": "We perform a comprehensive analysis of cosmic-ray propagation using the time-dependent AMS-02 flux measurements covering a full solar cycle, with particular emphasis on the role of solar modulation. We fit two representative Galactic propagation scenarios, convection- and re-acceleration-dominated models, in combination with three solar modulation prescriptions: the standard force-field approximation, an extended force-field model with a rigidity break, and the heliospheric propagation code $\\texttt{HelMod}$. The inclusion of time-resolved antiproton data provides a unique probe of charge-sign-dependent modulation effects and low-energy systematics. We find that the force-field approximation can describe positively charged nuclei reasonably well outside the solar maximum in convection-dominated models, but fails during periods of high solar activity and for antiprotons at all times. In re-acceleration scenarios, strong degeneracies between solar modulation and low-energy propagation lead to unphysical results when simple modulation models are employed. Across all models, we identify systematic uncertainties of order 10-15% in the reconstructed local interstellar spectra and propagation parameters, driven by limitations in current solar modulation modelling. Compared to the percent level error of current measurements, these uncertainties significantly limit the precision of cosmic-ray studies. Future time-dependent measurements spanning a full 22-year solar cycle will be crucial to reduce these uncertainties."}

While static EoS models are increasingly well-constrained by observations of binary neutron star (BNS) inspirals, the possibility of a dynamic phase transition occurring during the coalescence has been thus far deferred from standard gravitational-wave (GW) analyses. In this work, we investigate the detectability of such a phase transition, manifesting as a macroscopic shift in the tidal deformability parameter $Λ$, using GWs from Neutron Star-Black Hole (NSBH) coalescences. We argue that NSBH systems serve as a cleaner laboratory for this phenomenology than BNS systems due to the absence of the $\\tildeΛ(Λ_1,Λ_2)$ degeneracy, allowing for the isolation of single-body tidal evolution. We introduce a phenomenological waveform model, TROYE (Transitional Representation Of varYing Equation-of-state), which stitches together two waveform approximants in the time domain to simulate a smooth but rapid transition between two equations of state during the late inspiral. We perform a comprehensive Bayesian injection and recovery campaign on 100 simulated events using the bilby inference library. Our results demonstrate that a phase transition corresponding to a tidal shift of $|ΔΛ| \\gtrsim 400$ is detectable with Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, yielding decisive statistical evidence ($\\ln B > 5$). We further identify a \"V-shape\" asymmetry in detectability, where \"softening\" transitions (decreasing $Λ$) are systematically easier to detect than \"stiffening\" ones due to the specific phase evolution of the tidal sector. Finally, we present \"stress tests\" showing that the transition remains recoverable even when marginalized over uncertainties in the stitching time and binary mass ratio."}

All data products and fit coefficients used in this work are publicly available via Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18710119", "summary": "The mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is commonly inferred from the first two moments of the depth of shower maximum, $X_{\\rm max}$, measured by fluorescence and hybrid detectors. Such analyses require fast and accurate mappings between the moments of $X_{\\rm max}$ and those of the logarithmic mass, $\\ln A$, based on realistic air-shower simulations. In this work we provide updated parametrizations of the $X_{\\rm max}$ moments and distributions for air showers initiated by nuclei from proton to iron, simulated with CONEX for three state-of-the-art hadronic interaction models: Epos LHC-R, Sibyll 2.3e, and QGSJet-III-01. We parametrize the mean depth $\\langle X_{\\rm max}\\rangle$ and the variance $σ^2(X_{\\rm max})$ as functions of energy and mass. For the variance we compare a second-order polynomial model with an exponential model. In addition, we model the full $X_{\\rm max}$ distributions with a three-parameter generalized Gumbel function. The Gumbel parameters are fitted using an unbinned likelihood and are validated by comparing the implied mean and variance with the raw CONEX samples and with the moment parametrizations. Across the full energy range considered, residuals between the parametrizations (or the Gumbel representation) and the simulations are at the level of a few g cm$^{-2}$ for the mean and a few (g cm$^{-2}$)$^2$ for the variance, making these parametrizations suitable for precision UHECR composition studies and forward-folding analyses of $X_{\\rm max}$ distributions."}

It is an artefact of our ignorance of the properties of matter at supra-nuclear densities, which exist in the cores of neutron stars. The study addresses these problems with a physics-informed machine learning approach, guided by astrophysical observations. The Transformer model is trained on an agnostically generated ensemble of equations of state. Two geometric parameters are defined on the mass-radius sequence of a neutron star--the front bending and the back bending. The transformer provides a two-step solution: first, the model predicts the maximum mass and radius using the bending parameters. Second, it predicts the square of the sound speed profile, completing the inverse mapping. The prediction is that massive neutron stars form when the sound speed peaks at low density, leading to strong back-bending and an early phase transition to quark matter. Massive stars favour a stiff equation of state at low density, and the density of matter at the star's core is sufficiently small. The maximum mass for a neutron star predicted by the astrophysical constrained transformer model is $2.477$ solar masses, and a minimum radius of about $11.498$ km for a neutron star of $1.4$ solar masses."}

However, the evolution of the cold clumps has not been investigated in detail yet. In this paper, we conduct hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the evolution of the cold clumps. In addition to previous result that when the accretion rate is high enough the cold clumps emerge within the hot accretion flow, we found that instead of directly moving toward to the black hole, the clumps moves outward when they initially form. The reason should be the combination of viscous torque and the condensation of hot gas from larger radii, which lead to the slightly super-Keplerian angular momentum of the clumps. After reaching the equilibrium position, the clumps begin to fragment at the inner edge with each fragment moving inward sequentially. Generally, the azimuthal movement of the clumps are quasi-Keplerian, being closer to the outer detached Keplerian cold disk rather than the surrounding sub-Keplerian hot accretion flow, which agrees well with the semi-analytical results for weak coupling case in Wang et al. (2012)."}

Precise X-ray PMs are often limited by uncertainties in aligning observations to a common reference frame. Our analysis uses unresolved X-ray flux from stars in the Gaia catalog in addition to X-ray bright point sources for alignment, improving uncertainties. We obtain absolute positions referenced to Gaia with typical astrometric precision $\\sim$10 mas and PM statistical uncertainties down to 1.3 mas yr$^{-1}$, the most precise X-ray PM achieved to date. With our improved frame alignment, PM accuracies are now limited by the pulsar flux in most cases. These results reveal a new X-ray filament and illuminate the wind nebula structures and origins of several of these pulsars."}
