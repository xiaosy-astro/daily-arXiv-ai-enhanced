Abstract: Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGN) feature order-of-magnitude variability in both the continuum and broad line luminosities on months-to-years long timescales, and are currently unexplained. Simulations have demonstrated that rotating black holes sometimes tear apart tilted accretion disks. These tearing events violently restructure the disk on timescales much shorter than a viscous timescale, hinting at a connection to CLAGN. Here, we show that disk tearing can power changing-look events. We report synthetic observations of an extremely high resolution three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a geometrically thin, tilted accretion disk around a rapidly rotating, $10^8\,M_\odot$ black hole. We perform ray-tracing calculations that follow the disk light to both a line of sight camera and to a distribution of cameras in a prescribed torus-like broad line region. The continuum photoionizes the broad line region and we calculate the resulting spectrum. Both the continuum and line luminosities undergo order of magnitude swings on months-to-years long timescales. We find shorter, weeks long variability driven by the geometric precession of the inner disk and an intraday quasi-periodic oscillation driven by radial breathing of the inner disk. When the torn disk precesses, it causes asymmetric illumination of the broad line region, driving time-evolving red-to-blue asymmetries of the broad emission lines that may be a smoking gun for disk tearing. We also make predictions for future photometric observations from ULTRASAT and Vera Rubin Observatory, both of which may play an important role in detecting future changing-look events.

TL;DR: 对ASKAP巡天数据的10秒时间分辨率搜索未发现长周期射电暂现源，但识别了6颗恒星的射电耀发，并给出了暂现源表面密度的下限限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长周期射电暂现源(LPTs)是近期发现的现象，其周期在分钟到小时量级，填补了现有射电暂现源搜索技术的时间尺度空白。为增加已知LPTs样本，需要专门搜索。

Method: 使用ASKAP巡天项目的200小时存档数据，在750平方度天区进行10秒时间分辨率的成像搜索，这是首次在秒级分辨率下的大规模ASKAP数据搜索。

Result: 未探测到LPTs，但识别了6颗恒星的射电耀发，其中至少一颗是首次在射电波段探测到。给出了10秒时间尺度下暂现源表面密度的下限：2.21×10^-6 deg^-2，灵敏度为16.9 mJy。

Conclusion: 评估了使用ASKAP进行10秒成像探测射电暂现源的可行性，为改进LPTs的探测流程和观测策略提供了见解。

Abstract: Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a recently identified phenomenon that challenge our current understanding of compact objects and coherent radio emission mechanisms. These objects emit radio pulses similar to those of pulsars, but at much longer periods -- on the order of minutes to hours. With duty cycles of only a few percent, individual pulses have been observed to last between 10 and 1000 seconds. This places LPTs in a timescale gap between the two main techniques used in transient radio searches: time-series analysis at millisecond to second timescales, and image-plane searches sensitive to variability on the scale of days. As a result, LPTs remained undetected until recently, and only a handful are currently known. To increase the sample of known LPTs, we conducted a dedicated search using 200 hours of archival data from the ASKAP Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey, covering 750 deg$^2$ of sky at the shortest possible imaging time step of 10-seconds. This represents the first large-scale search using ASKAP data at second-scale resolution. Although no LPTs were detected, we identified flares from six stars, at least one had never been detected in the radio regime before. We placed a lower limit on the transient surface density of $2.21\times10^{-6}$ deg$^{-2}$ at a 10-second timescale, with a sensitivity of 16.9 mJy. Our findings evaluate the feasibility of detecting radio transients using 10-second imaging with ASKAP and provide insights into improving detection pipelines and observation strategies for LPTs.

Result: 所有GALPROP模型在不确定性范围内与中微子数据一致，考虑伽马射线点源污染后也与LHAASO数据预期一致。

Conclusion: 新模型提供了银河系甚高能中微子发射的最先进预测，可用于未来中微子搜索。

Abstract: We use the GALPROP cosmic ray (CR) propagation framework to model the diffuse neutrino and gamma-ray emissions from the Galaxy. A collection of realistic bounding models are developed and predictions of the resulting neutrino and gamma-ray signals are compared to the IceCube and LHAASO data up to PeV energies. We find that all the GALPROP models are consistent with the neutrino data within uncertainties. They are also consistent with expectations of neutrino emissions derived from LHAASO data when accounting for possible gamma-ray point source contamination. The new models present state-of-the-art predictions for the VHE neutrino emissions from the Galaxy that may be used for future neutrino searches.

TL;DR: GRB 250702B表现出超长、间歇性的前兆活动，通过黑洞吸积磁化喷流的进动模型解释其辐射和流出异常


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释GRB 250702B中观测到的超长、间歇性伽马射线暴活动，特别是三个硬伽马射线爆发和早期软X射线耀斑的成因

Method: 采用恒星质量黑洞从大质量、不对准的碎片盘吸积并发射磁主导、进动、结构化（脊柱-鞘层）喷流的统一模型

Result: 模型成功解释了爆发周期、光谱硬度、缺失脉冲等现象，并给出了可验证的预测

Conclusion: 该模型为GRB 250702B的辐射和流出异常提供了自洽的解释，解决了视张角张力问题

Abstract: GRB 250702B shows ultra long, episodic prompt activity, with three hard gamma ray episodes over about 3.2 h with quasi regular spacing P ~ 2825 s, preceded by a soft X ray flare about one day earlier. We interpret these phenomena with a unified scenario in which a stellar mass black hole accretes from a massive, misaligned debris disk and launches a magnetically dominated, precessing, structured (spine sheath) jet. The engine clock arises from Lense Thirring precession of the outer annulus of a geometrically thick inner torus at radius r ~ 250 to 300 gravitational radii, while the hard spectra reflect magnetic reconnection dissipation in the spine. A slightly off axis viewing geometry resolves the apparent opening angle tension without invoking late energy injection. "Missing" pulses in the second and third cycles occur naturally when low amplitude nutation causes the beaming cone to miss the line of sight. The model yields concrete, falsifiable predictions, providing a self consistent explanation of GRB 250702B radiative and outflow anomalies.

Conclusion: 同步辐射在HLX系统中的可行性为这些源的本质提供了新见解，需要进一步样本研究来评估大多数这类源是否由吸积中子星驱动。

Abstract: We present the first broadband spectral analysis of NGC 470 HLX1, a hyperluminous X-ray source that exhibits significant flux variability over different epochs. We investigate the feasibility of synchrotron radiation with varying latitude from a magnetized neutron star to explain the source's spectra. We also shed light on the particle acceleration mechanisms and maximum Lorentz factor of electrons within the neutron star magnetospheric plasma under super-Eddington accretion conditions. In our broadband spectral modeling, the detection of a blackbody-like component suggests the presence of a disk near the corotation radius or an outflow ejected from the disk. The viability of synchrotron emission in an HLX system offers new insights about the nature of these sources, motivating further sample studies to assess whether most of these sources are powered by accreting neutron stars.

Motivation: 目前望远镜难以直接精确测量活动星系核盘的气体密度分布，需要新的探测方法。

Method: 利用嵌入AGN盘中的双黑洞系统，通过空间引力波探测器跟踪其引力波演化来测量周围盘的气体密度。

Result: 通过多年观测，可以精确测量盘密度分布，误差可控制在2×10^-11 g/cm³以下。

Conclusion: 这项工作开辟了研究星系中心的新途径，通过引力波波形中的环境印记可以恢复盘气体密度分布。

Abstract: Massive black holes surrounded by a gaseous disk have been a prevailing model to explain a wide spectrum of astrophysical phenomena related to active galactic nucle (AGNs). However, direct and precise measurements of the disk density profiles remain elusive for current telescopes. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to pinpoint the gas density if an inspiralling stellar mass binary black hole is embedded in the AGN disk. Furthermore, if the barycenter of the pair follows an eccentric orbit around an AGN, then space-borne gravitational wave detectors can measure the density of the surrounding disk with multi-year observations by tracking the gravitational wave evolution. The error between the inferred density profile and the injected truth can be constrained to below $2\times10^{-11}\rm g/cm^3$. Our work opens up an exciting new channel to investigate the very center of galaxies, where disk gas density distributions $ρ(r)$ can be recovered by analyzing time-dependent environmental imprints in gravitational waveforms.

### [7] [Curious Case of CGRaBS J0211+1051: Observational Evidence of Lepto-Hadronic Origin of High-Energy Emission?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10329)

TL;DR: 对低同步峰BL Lac天体CGRaBS J0211+1051的多波段数据分析，发现两次主要伽马射线耀斑，X射线谱异常软，强子-轻子模型比纯轻子模型能更好解释观测数据，表明该源可能是潜在的中微子发射器和TeV亮源。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究CGRaBS J0211+1051的发射机制，特别是理解其异常软的X射线谱和光学活动与伽马射线变化的不一致性。

Method: 收集超过十年的多波段观测数据，使用纯轻子和强子-轻子两种建模方法，对四个不同时期的宽带SED进行拟合分析。

Result: 强子-轻子模型能更好地解释观测到的SED，特别是陡峭的光学-紫外谱；该源可能是潜在的中微子发射器和TeV亮源。

Conclusion: CGRaBS J0211+1051为检验耀变体喷流中强子-轻子对多信使发射的贡献提供了独特的测试平台。

Abstract: We present an extensive analysis of the multi-wavelength data of the low-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac object CGRaBS J0211+1051, which has been gathered over more than ten years with many observatories. Two major gamma-ray flares have been observed during the Fermi era: one in January 2011 and other in June 2019. During these events, CGRaBS J0211+1051 was also bright in other energy bands. On the other hand, there are also examples of optical activity that do not exhibit any comparable gamma-ray variability. Here, we study the temporal and spectral characteristics of the object in an attempt to understand the emission mechanisms operating in this source. A peculiar feature in its spectrum is the X-ray domain, which is unusually soft considering its object class. Interestingly, the relatively soft UV and optical spectrum does not extrapolate well to the X-rays. To mimic the observed SEDs during quiescent and flaring periods, we use both a purely leptonic and a hadro-leptonic modeling approach to reproduce four broadband SEDs from various epochs. When taking into account the steep optical-UV spectrum, we find that the hadro-leptonic scenarios better explains the SEDs compared to the purely leptonic model. The hadro-leptonic interpretation of the two gamma-ray flares suggests that CGRaBS J0211+1051 could be both a potential neutrino emitter and TeV-bright (E>10 TeV). Thus, it may offer a unique test bed to check for hadro-leptonic contributions to the multi-messenger emission in blazar jets.

Conclusion: 该方法验证了未来气球任务（如POEMMA-Balloon with Radio）从近空间环境进行目标观测的可行性。

Abstract: The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) mission launched from Wanaka New Zealand on May 13, 2023. The mission ended after 36 h due to a balloon leak that resulted in the payload being lost in the Pacific Ocean. Over the course of the mission, the onboard Cherenkov Telescope (CT) was pointed just below the Earth's limb to search for optical signals from upward-moving extensive air showers that were induced by decaying tau-leptons that were generated by the conversion of $>10$ PeV tau-neutrinos in Earth. Such very-high energy (VHE) neutrinos may be produced in several classes of astrophysical sources that are suspected of possibly accelerating particles to ultra-high energies. In this contribution, we discuss the EUSO-SPB2 Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) campaign to search for VHE neutrino signals coming from astrophysical sources that crossed the CT's field of view ($6.4^\circ \times 12.8^\circ$). We also present a new software tool designed for scheduling observations, the Neutrino Target Scheduler, that we developed to support the ToO campaign. We also calculate upper limits on the neutrino fluences from sources observed during the ToO campaign. Our observations demonstrate the viability of conducting ToO follow-up observations from a near space environment with future balloon missions, such as the pathfinder mission POEMMA-Balloon with Radio.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 该论文研究了X射线双星中准周期振荡(QPOs)的产生机制，认为广义相对论中的参考系拖拽效应可能导致吸积盘几何扭曲，从而解释QPO类型在状态转变期间的演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对X射线双星中宽带噪声(BBN)和准周期振荡(QPOs)的产生机制尚无共识，许多研究者认为QPOs可能由Lense-Thirring力矩引起的参考系拖拽效应产生。本文旨在研究这种参考系拖拽效应对吸积盘本身及其观测变异性的影响。

Method: 通过分析估计评估状态转变期间内吸积盘中几何扭曲的潜在存在，并分析扭曲如何改变光谱-时间特性。

Result: 研究表明吸积盘扭曲的存在可以以与观测到的爆发期间QPO类型转变相匹配的方式改变光谱-时间特性，并为Cyg X-1的特殊情况以及硬到软状态转变可能由扭曲本身驱动提供解释。

Conclusion: 扭曲的预期出现为状态转变期间BBN和QPO特性的演化提供了一致的解释，为统一黑洞X射线双星的变异性提供了第一条路径。

Abstract: X-ray binaries exhibit complex variability patterns studied in the power-spectrum. These include the broad-band noise (BBN) components and various types of narrow components called quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). There is currently no consensus about either what determines the presence/absence of the BBN or what generates the QPOs. Many believe the latter is due to frame-dragging effects caused by Lense-Thirring torques. We wish to investigate the potential impact of those frame-dragging effects on the accretion disk itself. In particular, we focus on its impact on the observed variability and the presence (and types) of QPOs associated. We make analytical estimates to assess the potential presence of a geometric warp in the inner accretion disk during state transitions. We show that the presence of a warp can modify the spectral-timing properties in a way that matches the observed transition between QPO types during outbursts. We also discuss the peculiar case of Cyg X-1, as well as how the hard-to-soft transition could be driven by the warp itself. The (expected) emergence of a warp provides a consistent explanation for the evolution of both the BBN and the QPO properties during state transitions. This offers a first path toward unifying the variability of black hole X-ray binary.

Motivation: PSR J1231-1411是NICER望远镜的重要科学目标，积累了丰富的γ射线和射电观测数据，通过精确测量其质量可以约束中子星内部状态方程。

Method: 使用Nançay和Green Bank射电望远镜15年的计时观测数据，应用频率主义和贝叶斯分析方法（后者结合白矮双星演化模型先验），通过检测相对论性夏皮罗延迟来测量脉冲星质量。

Result: 测得伴星质量0.23^{+0.09}_{-0.06} M⊙，脉冲星质量1.87^{+1.11}_{-0.67} M⊙，轨道倾角79.80^{+3.47}_{-4.70}度。限制脉冲星最大质量为3 M⊙时，测得质量为1.62^{+0.73}_{-0.58} M⊙。

Conclusion: 虽然质量约束相对较弱，但轨道倾角测量精度较高，这些经验将为未来高精度质量测量活动和中子星内部状态方程研究提供重要参考。

Abstract: We present 15 years of Nançay and Green Bank radio telescope timing observations for PSR J1231$-$1411. This millisecond pulsar is a primary science target for the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer telescope (NICER, which discovered its X-ray pulsations), has accumulated near-continuous $γ$-ray data since the Fermi-Large Area Telescope's launch, and has been studied extensively with the Green Bank and Nançay radio telescopes. We have undertaken a campaign with the Green Bank Telescope targeting specific orbital phases designed to improve our constraint on the pulsar's mass through the detection of a relativistic Shapiro delay. Both frequentist and Bayesian techniques -- the latter incorporating priors from white dwarf binary evolution models -- are applied to fifteen years of radio observations, yielding relatively weak constraints on the companion and pulsar masses of $0.23^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $1.87^{+1.11}_{-0.67}$ M$_{\odot}$, respectively (68.3% CI from Bayesian fits); however, the orbital inclination is measured to better relative precision ($79.80^{+3.47}_{-4.70}$ degrees). Restricting the maximum allowed pulsar mass to 3 M$_{\odot}$ while simultaneously sampling the noise and timing models improves the constraint and lowers the measured mass to $1.62^{+0.73}_{-0.58}$ M$_{\odot}$. While our radio-derived inclination result has informed recent NICER X-ray studies of PSR J1231$-$1411, the lessons learned from this troublesome pulsar will also bolster future high-precision mass measurement campaigns and resulting constraints on the neutron star interior equation of state.

TL;DR: H.E.S.S.观测发现V4641 Sgr周围存在延展的多TeV伽马射线辐射，能谱峰值约100 TeV，表明其可能是膝区以上的宇宙线加速源。尽管没有发现稠密气体靶物质，但观测结果更支持轻子起源而非强子起源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微类星体被认为是解释PeV能量宇宙线通量的候选天体，V4641 Sgr是LHAASO观测到的最极端例子，需要进一步研究其伽马射线发射特性。

Method: 使用约100小时的H.E.S.S.数据对V4641 Sgr周围的伽马射线进行光谱形态学研究，结合HI和CO观测推断宇宙线相互作用的靶物质分布。

Result: 检测到高显著性的多TeV辐射，辐射区域呈延展形态，能谱指数约1.8，能谱分布峰值在约100 TeV。发现可能的两成分形态(3σ)，V4641 Sgr位置与单成分模型最佳拟合位置不一致。未发现稠密气体靶物质。

Conclusion: 观测结果更支持伽马射线辐射的轻子起源，但并未排除V4641 Sgr系统中强子加速的可能性。能谱峰值在100 TeV确认V4641 Sgr是膝区以上的宇宙线加速候选源。

Abstract: Microquasars have emerged as promising candidates to explain the cosmic-ray flux at petaelectronvolt energies. LHAASO observations revealed V4641~Sgr as the most extreme example so far. Using $\approx$100~h of H.E.S.S. data, we performed a spectro-morphological study of the gamma-ray emission around V4641~Sgr. We employed HI and dedicated CO observations of the region to infer the target material for cosmic-ray interactions. We detected multi-TeV emission around V4641~Sgr with a high significance. The emission region is elongated. We found a power-law spectrum with an index $\approx$1.8, and together with results from other gamma-ray instruments, this reveals a spectral energy distribution that peaks at energies of $\approx$100~TeV for the first time. We found indications (3$σ$) of a two-component morphology, with indistinguishable spectral properties. The position of V4641~Sgr is inconsistent with the best-fit position of the single-component model and with the dip between the two components. We found no significant evidence of an energy-dependent morphology. No dense gas was found at any distance towards V4641~Sgr. The peak of the SED at $\approx$100~TeV identifies V4641~Sgr as a candidate cosmic-ray accelerator beyond the so-called knee. The absence of dense target gas places stringent energetic constraints on hadronic interpretations, however. The H.E.S.S. measurement requires an unusually hard ($\approx 1.5$) spectral index for the protons. A leptonic scenario faces fewer obstacles if the particle transport is fast enough to avoid losses and to reproduce the observed energy-independent morphology. The absence of bright \xray emission across the gamma-ray emission region requires a magnetic field strength $\lesssim3$~$μ$G, however. Our findings favour a leptonic origin of the gamma-ray emission. This conclusion does not exclude hadron acceleration in the V4641~Sgr system.

Motivation: 超高能宇宙射线与辐射场和星际物质相互作用会产生甚高能伽马射线和中微子，这些是多信使框架中的关键组成部分。研究旨在通过多信使观测理解高能天体物理源的性质及其在宇宙射线加速中的作用。

Method: 使用河外模拟计算宇宙射线亮度上限，应用H.E.S.S.和MAGIC观测得到的伽马射线通量上限，考虑河外和银河磁场对粒子传播的影响，约束最大河外磁场强度为10^{-14} G。

Result: 获得了伽马射线和中微子通量的上限，估算了单个源的UHECR亮度，并预测了切伦科夫望远镜阵列对NGC 1068伽马射线发射的探测能力。

Conclusion: 结合伽马射线、中微子和UHECR观测，强化了多信使方法在理解高能天体物理源性质及其在宇宙射线加速中作用的重要性。

Abstract: The detection of high-energy astrophysical multimessengers establishes a connection between ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and powerful cosmic accelerators. Interactions of UHECRs with radiation fields and interstellar matter generate very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays and neutrinos, making them key components in the multimessenger framework. This study examines the cosmogenic gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes resulting from UHECR propagation in starburst galaxies with supernova remnants, with a particular focus on NGC 1068, a well-established high-energy neutrino source. Using extragalactic simulations, we calculate the upper limit on cosmic-ray luminosity, applying upper limits on gamma-ray fluxes derived from observations by H.E.S.S. and MAGIC observatories. Our analysis incorporates the effects of both extragalactic and galactic magnetic fields on particle propagation, constraining the maximum extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF) intensity to $10^{-14}~\mathrm{G}$ to ensure that at least 90\% of injected UHECRs successfully reach Earth. The results provide upper limits on gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes, estimates of UHECR luminosity for individual sources, and predictions for the detection capabilities of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory regarding gamma-ray emission from NGC 1068. Combining gamma-ray, neutrino, and UHECR observations reinforces the importance of multimessenger approaches in understanding the nature of high-energy astrophysical sources and their role in cosmic-ray acceleration.
