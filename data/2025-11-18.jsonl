The polarization levels seen throughout our observations are on average 0.87% +/- 0.05% higher than those of any Type Ib SN~yet studied, suggesting either that it is the most asymmetric of the sample, or if all SNe Ib have similar asymmetry, that it is viewed at a more optimum angle. Significant continuum polarization indicates that the photosphere exhibited a global departure from spherical symmetry at the level of 10%-40% at the earliest times (days 0--40), which decreased to 0%-20% by days 57--90. During the early photospheric phase, the ejecta maintained a near-constant orientation of 12°-20° on the sky, as shown by the dominant axis in the Stokes q-u plane. Polarization signatures in the Fe II λλλ4924, 5018, 5169 lines shared this axis. Meanwhile, high levels of polarization associated with the He I lines traced distinct q-u loops with a dramatic rotation away from the dominant axis, indicating that the early-time ejecta were also characterized by hot, fast, helium-rich material concentrated near the poles. At day 295, during the transition to the nebular phase, a new, highly elongated structure became prominent in the ejecta, with an axis orthogonal to the dominant axis that defined the photospheric phase. This dual-axis geometry may link SN 2012au's high luminosity and asymmetric structure to a magnetar powering mechanism."}

In particular, if the observed black hole (BH) systems evolved in isolation, it is expected that they underwent a mass transfer phase. Given their highly unequal mass ratios, such mass transfer is dynamically unstable within standard models, leading to either a stellar merger or a final binary with a very short orbital period. In contrast, the observed systems have much wider orbits than predicted, making their formation within conventional evolutionary frameworks difficult to reconcile. With the aid of detailed binary evolution calculations, we test whether fully non-conservative mass transfer, where mass is lost from the system carrying the specific angular momentum of the donor's center of mass, can explain the properties of two of the Gaia BH systems. This mass-loss geometry differs from the standard isotropic re-emission model, which assumes mass loss from the accretor's vicinity. We find that our mass-loss model, without the need for fine-tuning, reproduces the observed orbital periods of the two Gaia BH systems remarkably well across a wide range of initial conditions. This scenario, therefore, offers a plausible formation pathway for these systems. We speculate that orbital widening during mass loss could result from the unequal Roche-lobe sizes of the components and eruptive mass loss driven by the donor's high-opacity subsurface layers. Similar mass loss may also be relevant for all other classes of post-mass-transfer binaries that face analogous evolutionary challenges, including Gaia neutron star and white dwarf systems, binaries hosting stripped-envelope Wolf-Rayet stars, and low-mass X-ray binaries."}

Variability at very short timescales can push the boundaries between competing models offering us much needed discriminating power. This is particularly true for polarization variability that allows us to probe particle acceleration and high-energy emission models in blazars. Here we present results from the first pilot study of intra-night optical polarization monitoring conducted using RoboPol at the Skinakas Observatory and supplemented by observations from the Calar Alto, Perkins, and Sierra Nevada observatories. Our results show that while variability patterns can widely vary between sources, variability on timescales as short as minutes is prevalent in blazar jets. The amplitude of variations are typically small, a few percent for the polarization degree and less than 20 degrees for the polarization angle, pointing to a significant contribution to the optical emission from a turbulent magnetic field component, while the overall stability of the polarization angle over time points to a preferred magnetic field orientation."}

Understanding the motion of this gas provides critical insight into processes such as mergers, turbulence, and energy dissipation in the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe. The Coma cluster is a nearby, massive system long suspected to be dynamically disturbed. Previous high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with the XRISM mission revealed bulk motions in the cluster core and southern regions. Here we present new XRISM Resolve observations of a northern region in Coma, which reveal a coherent velocity gradient of nearly $530 km/s across the cluster from south to north. We find that the hot gas in this northern region exhibits modest line-of-sight motions and uniform thermodynamic properties, indicating relatively mild local disturbances. The consistent levels of turbulence throughout the cluster suggest that the energy from a past merger has been distributed on large scales. These findings provide compelling evidence for an off-axis merger event and demonstrate how high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy can uncover subtle dynamical signatures in the ICM, offering important constraints for simulations of cluster evolution."}

We measure the properties of key emission features, namely those at 6300, 7300, and 7774 angstroms (associated with [O I], [Ca II]/[O II], and O I, respectively), and find that SLSNe exhibit much wider spectral diversity than normal SNe Ic, primarily in the line ratio $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$, which is highly sensitive to ejecta ionization. Some events exhibit weak [O I] and a clear [O II] contribution to the 7300 angstrom feature, enhancing the ratio, along with [O III] lines at 4363 and 5007 angstroms. Other SLSNe show weak or no lines of ionized oxygen. Moreover, we find that the population exhibits decreasing $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ over time, while a few outliers instead display sustained high or increasing ratios for extended periods. The ratio $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ is also correlated with the rise and decline times of the light curves, with slower events exhibiting higher ionization, the first robust connection between early light curve and late-time spectral properties, likely due to the magnetar's impact: slower-evolving SLSNe are generally powered by engines with longer spin-down timescales, which deposit more energy at later phases. Among the events with decreasing $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$, SLSNe with high ionization are on average powered by magnetars with higher thermalized spin-down power, a correlation that is most significant for events with $M_{\\rm ej}\\lesssim12$ M$_{\\odot}$. The ionization in the outliers with increasing $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ may be due to late CSM interaction. $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ and its evolution are therefore key diagnostics of SLSN engines and progenitor mass loss."}

The X-ray surface brightness profile perpendicular to the filament is detected at a $5.5σ$ level. Weak-lensing (WL) analysis using the Subaru/HSC-SSP Survey archive data strongly supports the two mass components.

The main axis of the projected halo distribution is more likely to align with the direction of the main cluster than to be oriented perpendicularly. Similar X-ray distributions have been identified in the literature on numerical simulations. The filamentary structure forms in the following manner: as the gas is stripped by ram pressure near the pericenter, it gets dragged by tidal rotation. Once free from this rotation, the gas moves inertially in a direction parallel to the tangential velocity at the pericenter. The comma-shaped gas, with tails pointing in the opposite direction to the main cluster, is also formed by the current tidal rotation as it moves away from the main cluster. This warrants us that, although it is sometimes thought based on the X-ray morphology alone that the tail is pointing in the opposite direction to the merger motion, this is not necessarily the case. The information of the X-ray filamentary remnant from the cluster merger, together with the 2D WL shear data, provides constraints on the merger parameters, indicating an infalling velocity of approximately $1000\\, {\\rm km\\, s^{-1}}$ and an impact parameter of $0.9$ Mpc."}

Recent researches have actively explored how the equation of state (EoS) can be constrained by observed neutron star masses and radii, and how nuclear interactions affect their macroscopic properties. Most of these studies, however, rely on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, which assumed static, spherically symmetric neutron stars. Since neutron stars are rotating objects and thus axisymmetrically deformed, the TOV calculation may be insufficient to capture their realistic structure. In this work, we investigate the influence of nuclear matter properties on the physical quantities of rotating neutron stars using two approaches: the perturbative Hartle-Thorne (HT) method and fully general relativistic Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu (KEH) method. For nuclear EoS parameter sets, we emamine the OMEG series, in which the slope of the symmetry energy $L$ is systematically varied. We find that rotational effects lead to a noticeable increase in the stellar radius, which depends sensitively on values of $L$. Additionally, focusing on the rotational deformation, we show that the results obtained by these two methods deviate each other even for the slowly rotating case such as $Ω=200$ Hz. These results reveal that, for detailed discussions on the internal structure and stability of rotating neutron stars, the fully general relativistic method such as KEH is indispensable."}

Although the physical origin of the plateau remains uncertain, the magnetar energy injection model offers a compelling explanation that reproduces the observed temporal and luminosity features. However, previous studies relying solely on X-ray data have suffered from strong parameter degeneracies when constraining the magnetar parameters. Here we perform broadband afterglow modeling on seven short GRBs with plateau features by combining X-ray, optical, and radio observations within the framework of the magnetar energy injection model. Key model parameters are derived by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. It is found that the energy injection substantially modifies the afterglow dynamics in most events. Compared with X-ray--only analyses, our broadband modeling yields systematically a lower magnetic field strength and a shorter spin period for the central magnetar, corresponding to a higher injection luminosity. The study clearly shows that incorporating multi-wavelength data effectively alleviates the degeneracy between the magnetar parameters and X-ray radiative efficiency. In addition, the distribution of our short GRBs differs markedly from long GRBs when they are plotted on the initial Lorentz factor versus gamma-ray energy plane. This offset, consistent with the observed harder spectrum of short GRBs, may serve as a useful diagnostic for investigating the progenitor as larger samples are available."}

Anyhow, the theoretical expectations need to be corroborated by clear observations. Despite the increasing number of detections at different energies, the contamination of other sources often makes it difficult to constrain the contribution arising from stellar winds only, unless one selects objects younger than a few million years, namely before stars start to explode inside clusters.
