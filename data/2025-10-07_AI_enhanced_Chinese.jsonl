Transient sources, in particular, benefit from the input of\nmulti-messenger observations, offering complementary perspectives on the same\nevent while maximizing the detection probability of a rapidly fading signal. In\nthis context, Gravitational Wave (GW) detections serve as perfect triggers for\npotential counterpart detections. Notably, a GW alert could be associated with\na Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB), jetted cataclysmic events produced either by the\ncollision of a binary neutron star system or a core-collapse supernova. These\nsources also radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing detection by\nX- and gamma-ray instruments aboard various satellites and thus enabling\nmulti-wavelength triggering opportunities. The strong interest in minimizing\nreaction time to capture the full-time evolution of the emission, together with\nthe often challenging localization uncertainties of the alerts, underscores the\nneed for rapid and well-coordinated follow-up programs such as the one\ndeveloped by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration.\n  This contribution will give an overview of the transient follow-up strategy\ncarried out by the H.E.S.S.

Among the key observables used to investigate their nature\nare the energy spectrum, the arrival direction distribution, and the\ncomposition as a function of energy. The composition of the primary cosmic ray\nis inferred from properties of the extensive air showers they initiate,\nparticularly from parameters sensitive to the primary mass. The most sensitive\nparameters to the primary mass are the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum,\ntypically measured with fluorescence telescopes, and the muon content of the\nshower, measured using dedicated muon detectors. A commonly used observable in\ncomposition studies is the muon density at a fixed distance from the shower\naxis, derived by evaluating the reconstructed muon lateral distribution\nfunction (MLDF) at a reference distance. A specific type of muon detector\nfeatures two acquisition modes: binary and integrator (commonly referred to as\nADC mode, for Analog-to-Digital Converter). The binary mode allows for direct\nmuon counting, while the ADC mode infers the muon number from the integrated\nsignal of the detector response. Existing methods reconstruct the MLDF using\ndata from either acquisition mode individually, or by combining both, but\nusually assigning a single mode per detector station in a given event. This\nwork presents a novel method to reconstruct the MLDF based on a likelihood\napproach that simultaneously incorporates data from both acquisition modes at\neach detector station. We apply our method to the underground muon detectors of\nthe Pierre Auger Observatory as a case study. However, this general approach\ncan be applied to future detectors with dual acquisition capabilities.

Exploring the full power of\nhigh-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of gamma Cas stars requires comparison of\nobservations of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines near 6.4 keV with\nsynthetic profiles of this line complex computed in the framework of the\nmagnetic interaction and the accreting WD scenarios. For the latter, we further\ndistinguish between accretion onto a non-magnetic and a magnetic WD. Our models\naccount for different reservoirs of reprocessing material: the Be circumstellar\ndecretion disk, the Be photosphere, an accretion disk around the WD companion,\na magnetically channelled accretion flow and the WD photosphere. We find\nconsiderably different line properties for the different scenarios. For a\nnon-magnetic accreting WD, the global Fe Kalpha complex is extremely broad,\nreaching a full width of 140 eV, whilst it is ~ 40 eV for the magnetic\nstar-disk interaction and the magnetic accreting WD cases. In the magnetic\nstar-disk interaction, the line centroid follows the orbital motion of the Be\nstar, whereas it moves along with the WD in the case of an accreting WD. For\ngamma Cas, given the 15 times larger amplitude of the WD orbital motion, the\nshift in position for an accreting WD should be easily detectable with\nhigh-resolution spectrographs such as Resolve on XRISM, but remains essentially\nundetectable for the magnetic star-disk interaction.

(2024) is\nextended to non-relativistic CRs. Interstellar CRs streaming into the clouds\nare able to resonantly excite MHD waves in diffuse cloud envelopes. This leads\nto the self-modulation, such that streaming particles are scattered at the\nself-generated waves. In contrast to relativistic CRs, transport of\nlower-energy particles in the envelopes is generally heavily affected by\nionization losses; furthermore, both CR protons and electrons contribute to\nwave excitation. We show that these effects have profound impact on the\nself-modulation, and can dramatically reduce CR spectra even for clouds with\nmoderate column densities of a few times $10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Recently, several PTAs have found evidence\nfor the presence of GWs in their datasets, but none of them have achieved a\ncommunity-defined definitive (> 5$\\sigma$) detection. Here, we identify\nlimiting noise sources for PTAs and quantify their impact on sensitivity to GWs\nunder different observing and noise modelling strategies. First, we search for\nintrinsic pulse jitter in a sample of 89 MSPs observed by the MeerKAT Pulsar\nTiming Array and obtain new jitter measurements for 20 MSPs. We then forecast\njitter noise in pulsars for the future SKA-Mid telescope, finding that the\ntiming precision of many of the best-timed MSPs would be dominated by jitter\nnoise. We then consider dispersion measure variations from the interstellar\nmedium and find that their effects are best mitigated by modelling them as a\nstationary Gaussian process with a power-law spectrum. Improving upon the\nestablished hasasia code for PTA sensitivity analysis, we assess the timing\npotential of the lower frequency UHF-band (544$-$1088\\,MHz) of MeerKAT and find\na potential increase in GW background sensitivity by $\\approx 8$\\%, relative to\nobserving at L-band. We show that this improvement relies on assumptions on the\npropagation through the interstellar medium, and highlight that if observing\nfrequency-dependent propagation effects, such as scattering noise, are present,\nwhere noise is not completely correlated across observing frequency, then the\nimprovement is significantly diminished. Using the multi-frequency receivers\nand sub-arraying flexibility of MeerKAT, we find that focussed, high-cadence\nobservations of the best MSPs can enhance the sensitivity of the array for both\nthe continuous GWs and stochastic GWB. These results highlight the role of\nMeerKAT and the MPTA in the context of international GW search efforts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work, we present results of XMM-Newton mosaic\nobservations of a third, southwestern, cold front at a radius of $r \\approx\n250$ kpc, originally discovered with Suzaku. All three cold fronts are likely\nto be parts of an enormous swirling pattern, rooted in the core. The comparison\nwith a numerical simulation of a binary cluster merger indicates that these\ncold fronts were produced in the same single event $-$ likely the infall of M49\nfrom the northwest of Virgo and it is now re-entering the cluster from the\nsouth. This outermost cold front has probably survived for $2-3$ Gyr since the\ndisturbance. We identified single sharp edges in the surface brightness\nprofiles of the southern and southwestern sections of the cold front, whereas\nthe western section is better characterized with double edges. This implies\nthat magnetic fields have preserved the leading edge of the cold front, while\nits western side is beginning to split into two cold fronts likely due to\nKelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The slopes of the 2D power spectrum of the\nX-ray surface brightness fluctuations, derived for the brighter side of the\ncold front, are consistent with the expectation from Kolmogorov turbulence. Our\nfindings highlight the role of cold fronts in shaping the thermal dynamics of\nthe intracluster medium beyond the cluster core, which has important\nimplications for cluster cosmology. Next-generation X-ray observatories, such\nas the proposed AXIS mission, will be ideal for identifying and characterizing\nancient cold fronts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
