At low frequencies, the emission\ncomes from the turbulent ambient medium surrounding the jet that obscures the\ninner jet structure. Electronic Vector Position Angle (EVPA) patterns are\nperpendicular to the jet propagation direction, indicating a dominance of the\npoloidal magnetic field. At high frequencies, bright knots and twisted kink\nstructures appear, and EVPA patterns are consistent with a toroidal magnetic\nfield. We also find that QPOs in light curves of intensity and linear\npolarization (degree and angle). The peak frequency in Power Spectral Densities\n(PSDs) is well-matched with the rotation period of the kink structure in\nrelativistic jets.

The persistent emission is well\ndescribed by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model. An absorption edge is\nalso detected at an energy of approximately 7.87 keV, which indicates the\npresence of absorbing material in the vicinity of this system. Six bursts have\nbeen observed during this observation, wherein we find the burst recurrence\ntime to be approximately 4.52 hr. All the bursts exhibit the characteristics of\na sharp rise and exponential decay. We perform the time-resolved spectroscopy\nof the burst spectra described by a model consisting of thermal emission from\nthe neutron star surface and a varying persistent emission component to study\nthe evolution of burst parameters. The enhancement of the persistent emission\nduring burst exposure is characterized by the scaling parameter f a, which\nreflects the increasing strength of the burst-disc interaction with burst\nintensity, likely driven by Poynting-Robertson drag. The spectral analysis of\nbursts estimate the average apparent blackbody emitting radius of the neutron\nstar to lie within 1.5-3.5 km.

To improve precision of gravitational wave measurements, pulsar\ntiming array (PTA) collaborations have begun the use of sophisticated and\nintricate noise modelling techniques such as modelling stochastic variations\ninduced by the turbulent IISM and quasi-deterministic processes attributed to\ndiscrete structures. However, the reliability of these techniques has not been\nstudied in detail, and it is unclear whether the recovered processes are\nphysical or if they are impacted by misspecification. In this work, we present\nan analysis to test the efficacy of IISM noise models based on the data from\nthe MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array (MPTA) 4.5-year data release. We first\nperformed multi-frequency, long-length (500 refractive length scale)\nsimulations of multipath propagation in the IISM to study the properties of\nscattering variations under a variety of scattering conditions. The results of\nour simulations show the possibility of significant radio-frequency\ndecorrelation in the scattering variations, particularly for the anisotropic\nscattering medium. Our analysis of the observed DM and scattering variations\nusing the MPTA 4.5-year data set shows that there can be apparent\nanticorrelations between DM and scattering variations, which we attribute to\nthe model fitting methods. We also report a possibility that plasma\nunderdensities might exist along the sight lines of PSR J1431$-$5740 and PSR\nJ1802$-$2124. Finally, using simulations, we show that the IISM noise models\ncan result in the apparent measurement of strong frequency dependence of\nscattering variations observed in the MPTA data set.

In this\nwork, we present the first spectral covariance analysis of the SGWB using data\nfrom the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration during the third and the first part of\nthe fourth observing runs. Our analysis indicates that the current spectral\ncorrelation is consistent with non-stationary noise, yielding no detection from\nthe current data and providing only upper bounds between frequencies in the\nrange 25 Hz to 100 Hz.

Its puzzling\nfeature is the presence of a strong and broad Fe K line, while the continuum\nconsists of a strong disk blackbody and a very weak power-law tail. The\nirradiation of the disk by a power-law spectrum fitting the tail is much too\nweak to account for the strong line. Two solutions were proposed in the past.\nOne invoked an intrinsic Fe K disk emission, and the other invoked disk\nirradiation by the returning blackbody emission. We instead find that the\nstrong line is naturally explained by the irradiation of the disk by the\nspectrum from Comptonization of the disk blackbody by coronal relativistic\nelectrons. The shape of the irradiating spectrum at $\\lesssim$10 keV reflects\nthat of the disk blackbody; it is strongly curved and has a higher flux than\nthat of a fit with a power-law irradiation. That flux accounts for the line.\nWhile this result is independent of the physical model used for the disk\nintrinsic emission, the value of the fitted spin strongly depends on it. When\nusing a Kerr disk model for a thin disk with a color correction, the fitted\nspin corresponds to a retrograde disk, unlikely for a Roche-lobe overflow\nbinary.

The X-ray spectra of these SNe are consistent with\ninteraction with the circumstellar medium (CSM), with the possible exception of\nSN 1979C, which shows an additional hard component, as also noted in previous\nstudies at earlier epochs. This emission may be due to a pulsar wind nebula.\nUsing the upper limits in the full sample, we also perform a population\nsynthesis to constrain the fraction of SNe that produce pulsars and the\nproperties of the pulsars themselves.

Such an\naccretion flow is externally illuminated by X-ray radiation from a lamp located\nabove a central SMBH. Thermal lines from highly ionized iron ions (FeXXV and\nFeXXVI), caused by both internal heating and reflection from the warm corona,\ncan be integrated into an observed broad line profile due to the close vicinity\nof the SMBH. We investigate the dependence of the broad line profile by varying\nthe SMBH spin parameter, viewing angle, lamp height, and dissipation factor.\nOur results introduce a new method to probe properties of the warm corona using\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic measurements. We use the photoionization code\nTITAN to compute local ion populations and emission line profiles, and the\nray-tracing code GYOTO to include relativistic effects on the outgoing X-ray\nspectrum. In our models, the temperature of the inner atmosphere covering the\ndisk can reach values of 10^7 - 10^8 K due to internal warm corona dissipation\nand external illumination, which is adequate for generating the highly ionized\niron lines. These lines can undergo significant gravitational redshift near the\nblack hole, leading to a prominent spectral feature centered around 6.4 keV.\nFor all computed models, the relativistic corrections shift highly ionized iron\nlines to the X-ray region, usually attributed to fluorescent emission from the\nilluminated skin of an accretion disk. Hence, in the case of a warm corona\ncovering the inner disk regions, the resulting theoretical line profile under\nstrong gravity is a sum of different iron line transitions, and those\noriginating from highly ionized iron contribute the most to the observed total\nline profile in AGN."}

Its bounds and density\nprofile carry crucial information about the nature of superdense matter.\nPhysically, the EOS-parameter $\\phi$ represents the mean stiffness of matter\naccumulated from the stellar surface up to a given density. Based on the\nintrinsic structure of the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, we show that\n$\\phi$ decreases monotonically outward from the NS center, independent of any\nspecific input NS EOS model. Furthermore, observational evidence of a peak in\nthe speed-of-sound squared (SSS) density-profile near the center effectively\nrules out a valley and a subsequent peak in the radial profile of $\\phi$ at\nsimilar densities, reinforcing its monotonic decrease. These model-independent\nrelations impose strong constraints on the near-center behavior of the\nEOS-parameter $\\phi$, particularly demonstrating that the mean stiffness (or\nequivalently $\\Delta$) reaches a local maximum (minimum) at the center."}
