Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "In the past decade, Swift has performed several AGN high-cadence\nreverberation mapping campaigns, and generally found that the UV/optical\ninterband lags are $\\sim$3 times longer than predicted for a standard thin\ndisk, thus coined \"the accretion disk size problem\". Here we present a\nsystematic sample of Swift-monitored AGN. In this analysis, we confirm the\naccretion disk size problem, but find that the lag excess occurs only in the\nsubset of obscured AGN, which show a significantly elevated mean normalization\nof $5.21 \\pm 0.47$ ($p = 0.008$), whereas the unobscured AGN exhibit a mean\nexcess consistent with standard disk predictions ($1.00 \\pm 0.31$). Correlation\nand regression analyses similarly reveal X-ray column density as the strongest\npredictor of lag excess, explaining over 80% of its variance. We interpret\nthese results as line-of-sight obscuration being linked to the too-long lags\nvia additional reprocessed emission from the absorbing material itself. The\nconsistency of lags in the unobscured subgroup with standard disk predictions\nsuggests that the accretion disk size problem is not the result of shortcomings\nof standard accretion disk theory nor contamination by the broad-line region\n(BLR). X-ray to UV lag amplitudes and correlations show more complex and\nvariable behavior in obscured AGN, suggesting that obscuration may disrupt or\ncomplicate the connection between high- and low-energy emission potentially\nthrough reprocessing, scattering, and/or ionization changes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

One\nof the best of these is the 3 year optical/UV/X-ray approximately daily\nmonitoring campaign on Fairall\\,9, a fairly typical moderate accretion rate\nAGN. The UV lightcurve shows a clear increase over $\\sim 50$ days between years\n1 and 2, strongly coherent with the X-ray lightcurve rise. This changes the\naverage spectral energy distribution such that the disc component is stronger\nwhile the X-ray spectrum steepens, so that the total X-ray power remains\nroughly constant. Outside of this global change, we apply a Fourier resolved\nanalysis to test stochastic models where intrinsic fluctuations in the UV disc\npropagate down into the hard X-ray emission region via both changing the seed\nphoton flux for Compton scattering (short light travel timescale) and changing\nthe electron density (longer propagation timescale). Unlike these models, the\nhard X-rays are not particularly well correlated with the UV, and also have the\nwrong sign in that the hard X-rays marginally lead the UV fluctuations. We show\nthat this is instead consistent with uncorrelated stochastic fluctuations in\nboth the UV (slow) and X-ray (fast), which are linked together only weakly via\nlight travel time.

We find that the neutron dark decay rate in medium is\nquite slow, and thus the dark baryons modify the dense matter equation of state\nin a way that decreases the Urca bulk viscosity by, at most, a factor of 2-3.\nHowever, if the neutron dark decay was to occur more rapidly, then the bulk\nviscosity at merger temperatures of tens of MeV would be strongly enhanced,\npotentially rapidly damping oscillations in merger environments and therefore\nproviding a signature of slowly equilibrating matter in the merger.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These results\nsuggest that obscuration may play an important role in explaining the unusual\nTDE-like variability observed in CSS100217.", "AI": {"tldr": "CSS100217\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u6f6e\u6c50\u7834\u574f\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08TDE\uff09\u5019\u9009\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff08SMBH\uff09\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u906e\u853d\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u906e\u853d\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u4e0d\u5bfb\u5e38\u7684TDE\u6837\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u8d77\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u906e\u853d\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u91caCSS100217\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u5178\u578b\u7684TDE\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u5149\u53d8\u540e\u4eae\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5149\u53d8\u524d\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u800cCSS100217\u7684\u4eae\u5ea6\u5728\u5149\u53d8\u540e\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7ea60.4\u4e2a\u661f\u7b49\u3002", "method": "\u5047\u8bbe\u7531TDE\u672a\u675f\u7f1a\u7684\u6052\u661f\u6b8b\u9ab8\u6216\u6838\u4e91\u56f4\u7ed5\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff08SMBH\uff09\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u906e\u853d\u9075\u5faa\u5a01\u5e03\u5c14\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5f97\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u660e\uff0cCSS100217\u7684\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u53ef\u75314.6\u00b10.9\u500d\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e3b\u5e8f\u661f\u88ab3.3\u00d710^7\u00b10.3\u500d\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6f6e\u6c50\u7834\u574f\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u603b\u80fd\u91cf\u4e3a7.23\u00d710^53 ergs\uff0c\u7ea61.38\u500d\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6b8b\u9ab8\u88ab\u5438\u79ef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u906e\u853d\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u89e3\u91caCSS100217\u7684\u5f02\u5e38TDE\u6837\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u5bf9\u5149\u53d8\u524d\u5149\u5b66\u4eae\u5ea6\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u4e0d\u5927\u3002"}}

Follow-up pulsation searches with MeerKAT\nconfirmed pulsations from GPM J1723-33, while the non-detections of the other\nthree are likely due to scattering by material ablated from their companion\nstars.

We conclude that the properties of precursor,\nmain burst and the following soft X-ray emission strongly support the atypical\ncollapsar Ultra-Long Gamma-Ray Burst (ULGRB) scenario rather than the Tidal\nDisruption Event (TDE), and all these gamma-ray and soft X-ray emission\nprobably originate from relativistic jet whose luminosity is dominated by the\nfallback accretion rate during the death collapse of a supergiant star.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86GRB 250702B/EP250702a\u7684\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u66b4\u53ca\u5176\u540e\u7eed\u8f6fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u8f90\u5c04\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u524d\u5146\u548c\u4e3b\u66b4\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u5178\u578b\u574d\u7f29\u55b7\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u957f\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u66b4\uff08ULGRB\uff09\u800c\u975e\u6f6e\u6c50\u5265\u79bb\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08TDE\uff09\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3GRB 250702B/EP250702a\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ETJASMIN\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408Insight-HXMT\u3001GECAM\u548cFermi/GBM\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf930\u5929\u5185\u7684\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u7206\u53d1\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u5e26\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e3b\u7206\u524d25\u5c0f\u65f6\u768450\u79d2\u524d\u5146\uff0c\u5305\u542b4\u6b21\u53d1\u5c04\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3b\u7206\u540e\u7684\u8f6fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u8f90\u5c04\u7b26\u5408\u5e42\u5f8b\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u6307\u6570\u4e3a-5/3\uff0c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u56de\u843d\u5438\u79ef\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u524d\u5146\u3001\u4e3b\u66b4\u53ca\u540e\u7eed\u8f6fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u7279\u6027\u5f3a\u70c8\u652f\u6301\u975e\u5178\u578b\u574d\u7f29\u8d85\u957f\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u66b4\uff08ULGRB\uff09\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6f6e\u6c50\u5265\u79bb\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08TDE\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6240\u6709\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u548c\u8f6fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u8f90\u5c04\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u55b7\u6d41\uff0c\u5176\u4eae\u5ea6\u7531\u8d85\u5de8\u661f\u6b7b\u4ea1\u574d\u7f29\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u56de\u843d\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002"}}

The precise spatial and spectral measurements of diffuse\nGalactic gamma-ray emission provide new avenues for unraveling this mystery.\nBased on 16 years of Fermi-LAT observations, we find that the diffuse gamma-ray\nspectral shapes are nearly identical for low energies (below a few GeV) but\nshow significant dispersion at high energies (above a few GeV) across the\nGalactic disk. We further show that the diffuse emission can be decomposed into\ntwo components, a universal spectral component dominating at low energies which\nis consistent with the expectation from interactions of background cosmic rays\nand the interstellar matter, and a spatially variant component dominating at\nhigh energies which is likely due to local accelerators. These findings suggest\nthat there is dual-origin of the Galactic diffuse emission, including the\n``cosmic ray sea'' from efficient propagation of particles and the ``cosmic ray\nislands'' from inefficient propagation of particles, and thus shed new light on\nthe understanding of the propagation models of Galactic cosmic rays.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e16\u5e74\u7684\u8d39\u7c73-LAT\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u73b0\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u5f25\u6f2b\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u5728\u4f4e\u80fd\u533a\u57df\u8c31\u5f62\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u80fd\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u6765\u6e90\uff1a\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u6d77\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u5c9b\u5c7f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u662f\u7c92\u5b50\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5f25\u6f2b\u94f6\u6cb3\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8c31\u6d4b\u91cf\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8d39\u7c73-LAT\u768416\u5e74\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u7684\u8c31\u5f62\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u6210\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u4f4e\u80fd\u533a\u57df\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u8c31\u5f62\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u9ad8\u80fd\u533a\u57df\u8c31\u5f62\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u51fa\u4f4e\u80fd\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8c31\u6210\u5206\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u6210\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u5f25\u6f2b\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u6709\u53cc\u6e90\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u5373\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u6d77\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u5c9b\u5c7f\uff0c\u8fd9\u542f\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

We have performed a comprehensive\nanalysis of the relevant X-ray data to investigate the spectral and temporal\nproperties of this source between October 2000 and July 2024.

Instead, we suggest a symbiotic binary/recurrent\nnova scenario, which gains support from many of the observed X-ray properties\nof Swift J174610 and a close comparison with the famous Galactic recurrent nova\nRS Oph. If confirmed, Swift J174610 would represent the first nova detected in\nthe Galactic center, offering new insights into the otherwise elusive\npopulation of massive white dwarfs as well as wide binaries in the close\nvicinity of Sgr A*.
