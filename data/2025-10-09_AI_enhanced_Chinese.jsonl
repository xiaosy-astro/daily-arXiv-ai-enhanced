The GRB afterglow radiation\nprovides a powerful means to investigate the microphysics of relativistic\nshocks and to probe the medium surrounding the progenitor of the burst. In this\nstudy, we present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of 31 GRBs observed\nbetween 2008 and 2024 from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (X-ray Telescope\nand Burst Alert Telescope) and the Fermi Large Area Telescope, covering photon\nenergies from 0.3 keV to 300 GeV. Our goal is to characterize the broadband\nspectral properties of GRB afterglows in soft X-rays, hard X-rays, and\nhigh-energy gamma rays. We investigate correlations between spectral shape and\nenergy output across different parts of the spectrum. The observed emission is\nmodeled using a forward shock scenario that includes both synchrotron and\nsynchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation losses. The results favor an\nSSC-dominated radiation model in a wind-like medium, consistent with\nexpectations for long-duration GRBs. Crucially, this work provides new\nbenchmarks for the microphysical parameters governing the emission,\nparticularly indicating a notably low magnetic energy fraction, which refines\nprevious estimates. By modeling broadband data, this study offers one of the\nmost detailed SSC analyses in a wind-like environment to date.

During the long-term monitoring period, the bolometric\nluminosity of the source varies between ($1.32-17)\\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$.\nOptical spectroscopic monitoring reveals changing-look (CL) behaviour in\nNGC~3822, characterized by the appearance and disappearance of broad emission\nlines (BELs). These CL transitions are associated with changes in the Eddington\nratio rather than changes in the obscuration. The BELs appear only when the\nEddington ratio is relatively high ($\\sim 3.8\\times10^{-3}$) and disappear when\nit drops to a lower value ($\\sim 0.9\\times10^{-3}$).", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, we utilise a sample of 29 FRBs with\nmeasured high-time-resolution properties and known redshift, which were\ndetected using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) by the\nCommensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients Survey (CRAFT), to model these\ndistributions. Using this sample, we estimate the completeness bias of\nintrinsic width and scattering measurements, and fit the underlying, de-biased\ndistributions in the host rest-frame. We find no evidence for a down-turn\ntowards high values of the intrinsic distributions of either parameter in the\n0.01-40 ms range probed by the data. Rather, the intrinsic scattering\ndistribution at 1 GHz is consistent with a log-uniform distribution above 0.04\nms, while the intrinsic width distribution rises as a Gaussian in log-space in\nthe 0.03-0.3 ms range, and is then log-uniform above that. This is inconsistent\nwith previous works, which assumed that these parameters have lognormal\ndistributions. This confirms that FRB observations are currently strongly\nwidth- and scattering-limited, and we encourage FRB searches to be extended to\nhigher values of time-width. It also implies a bias in FRB host galaxy studies,\nalthough the form of that bias is uncertain. Finally, we find that our updated\nwidth and scattering model - when implemented in the zDM code - produces 10%\nmore FRBs at redshift $z=1$ than at $z=0$ when compared to alternative\nwidth/scattering models, highlighting that these factors are important to\nunderstand when performing FRB population modelling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u752829\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5df2\u77e5\u7ea2\u79fb\u7684FRB\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u4e4b\u524d\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5206\u522b\u5448\u73b0\u5bf9\u6570\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "FRB\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u5206\u5e03\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u73af\u5883\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u662f\u68c0\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ca\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u81eaASKAP\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684CRAFT\u5de1\u5929\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf929\u4e2aFRB\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u56fa\u6709\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u62df\u5408\u8131\u504f\u540e\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u56fa\u6709\u6563\u5c04\u5206\u5e03\u57281 GHz\u59040.04\u6beb\u79d2\u4ee5\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6570\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u56fa\u6709\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u57280.03-0.3\u6beb\u79d2\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5448\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u8be5\u8303\u56f4\u5219\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6570\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u6709\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "conclusion": "FRB\u89c2\u6d4b\u76ee\u524d\u53d7\u5230\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e94\u9f13\u52b1\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5bbd\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u641c\u7d22\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u6697\u793a\u4e86FRB\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5177\u4f53\u5f62\u5f0f\u5c1a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u3002\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u5728zDM\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6bd4\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b10%\u66f4\u591a\u7684z=1\u7ea2\u79fb\u7684FRB\u3002"}}

Strong"], "title": "The gamma-ray emission from Radio Galaxies and their contribution to the Isotropic Gamma-Ray Background", "comment": null, "summary": "We evaluate the contribution to the Isotropic Gamma-Ray Background (IGRB)\ncoming from Radio Galaxies (RGs), the subclass of radio-loud Active Galactic\nNuclei (AGN) with the highest misalignment from the line of sight (l.o.s.).\nSince only a small number of RGs are detected in gamma rays compared to the\nlargest known radio population, the correlation between radio and gamma-ray\nemission serves as a crucial tool to characterize the gamma-ray properties of\nthese sources. We analyse the population of RGs using two samples. The first\nsample contains 26 sources individually detected by the Large Area Telescope\n(LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope at gamma rays. The second\nsample contains 210 RGs for which the gamma-ray emission is not significantly\ndetected by the LAT. We use a stacking analysis to characterize the average\nproperties of the gamma-ray emission of the two samples, separately at first\nand then combined. We then evaluate the correlation between their gamma-ray\nemission and the emission from their radio core at 5 GHz, and we use it to\ndetermine their contribution to the IGRB. Due to the limited number of RGs\ndetected at the gamma-rays, information on the gamma-ray luminosity function is\nlimited. The correlation between the gamma-ray emission and the emission of the\nradio core allows us to characterize it starting from the luminosity function\nof the radio cores, which is modeled with greater accuracy due to the larger\nnumber of sources detected at these frequencies. We find that the diffuse\nemission as extrapolated from the properties of the subthreshold RGs is lower\nthan the one inferred from detected RGs, showing that the contribution of the\npopulation of RGs to the IGRB is lower than the previous estimates and it is\naround the 30% level of the IGRB intensity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Recent measurements reveal anisotropies in\narrival directions, a rigidity-dependent composition dominated by\nintermediate-mass nuclei, and striking hemispheric differences in the energy\nspectra. Here we show that rare transients in nearby galaxies can naturally\naccount for these features. In our fiducial neutron-star merger model, the\ncosmic ray flux above $25$ EeV is dominated by ten nearby galaxies within\n$8\\,$Mpc. This accounts for the observed hotspots: seven of the ten brightest\ngalaxies coincide with reported excess regions, a chance probability of\n$p\\simeq0.003$. Nearby transients also explain the spectral excess of TA over\nAuger; link their angular sizes to extragalactic magnetic fields at $\\sim$1 nG;\nexplain the dominance of individual species over narrow energy ranges; and the\nrigidity-aligned succession of isotopes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
