In the present study, we investigate formation of the circumstellar matter (CSM) in double white-dwarf (WD) mergers. We further study the interaction between the CSM and the SN ejecta. We first model the orbital evolution and super-Eddington mass transfer/ejection in the double WD systems. We then conduct hydrodynamical and light-curve (LC) simulations of the SN-CSM interaction, assuming a prompt SN Ia explosion in a context of the carbon-ignited violent merger (C-ignited VM). Our simulations show that at the moment of the merger, the binary system has the CSM distribution following $ρ_{\\mathrm{CSM}}\\simeq D(r/10^{14}\\ \\mathrm{cm})^{-3.5}\\ (D\\simeq 10^{-14}\\text{--}10^{-13}\\ \\rm g\\ cm^{-3})$. The simulated LCs reproduce the early flux excesses across optical to UV bands, as well as their color evolution, observed in the VM candidates, i.e., 03fg/02es-like SNe Ia. This supports that 03fg/02es-like objects originate from the VM explosions. We also discuss the case of the helium-ignited VM, which might be realized in some WD-WD mergers depending on the He content in the system. Focused here is the timing when the explosion is initiated, and we find that the explosion is initiated after the companion WD is, at least partially, tidally disrupted also in this case; we thus expect the formation of the CSM through the mass transfer phase also for the helium-ignited VM scenario."}

Leveraging Jax and NumPyro for differentiable forward modeling and efficient Bayesian inference, FEADME enables large-sample, reproducible analyses of disk-dominated emission-line profiles. We apply the framework to 237 double-peaked emitters (DPEs) from the literature and to five tidal disruption events (TDEs) with disk-like H$α$ emission, fitting three physically motivated model families per spectrum and selecting the preferred model using approximate leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. We find that AGN exhibit a broad, continuous distribution of disk geometries and kinematics, with significant diversity in disk parameters. Most TDE disk parameter distributions are statistically indistinguishable from those of the AGN, with the sole robust difference being that TDE disks are significantly more circular, consistent with rapid debris circularization in tidal disruption events. The majority of both AGN and TDEs favor models that include both a disk and an additional broad-line component, suggesting that disk emission commonly coexists with more isotropic or wind-driven gas. These results indicate that once a line-emitting disk forms, its spectroscopic appearance is governed by similar physical processes in both persistent AGN and transient TDE accretion flows, and they demonstrate the utility of FEADME for population-level studies of disk structure in galactic nuclei."}

Magnetars highly magnetized neutron stars and a leading progenitor candidate for FRBs also produce similar but much fainter millisecond radio pulses, suggesting a possible connection between the two phenomena. The irregularity of the time series of repeating FRBs and magnetar pulses may provide insight into the underlying progenitor activity. In this study, we analyze time-series data from three repeating FRB sources (four datasets) and the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 to investigate potential patterns in burst arrival times, energy fluctuations, and peak-frequency shifts. We quantify the degree of randomness (Pincus Index; PI) and chaos (Largest Lyapunov Exponent; LLE) for these three parameters. We find that waiting times across all repeating FRBs exhibit high PI (high randomness) and low LLE (low chaos), consistent with the behavior of magnetar radio pulses. This similarity suggests that both may share a common triggering mechanism. In contrast, the energy fluctuations of both repeating FRBs and magnetar pulses occupy the same region in PI-LLE phase space but display much larger scatter than the other two domains. We discuss the possibility that beaming effects or strong variability in radio-emission efficiency may explain their distinct behavior in the energy domain."}

A jet with an inhomogeneous Lorentz factor distribution develops internal shocks both below and above the photosphere, relaxing toward homologous expansion. Below the photosphere, neutrons, whose mean free paths are much longer than those of charged particles, play an essential role in the dissipation process. Using neutron-inclusive shell simulations with initial conditions based on the collapsar scenario, we link the statistical inhomogeneity of the jet at the breakout of the progenitor to the dissipation that occurs inside and outside the photosphere, and calculate the GeV-TeV neutrino counterpart originated from inelastic neutron-proton interactions consistently with the prompt gamma-ray emission. We find that the peak energy of the GeV-TeV neutrinos is in 10-30 GeV irrespective to the baryon loading factor of the jet, with the high-energy tail extending into the TeV range as the amplitude of the time variability becomes stronger. When gamma-ray emission is efficient as in typical GRBs (i.e., the gamma-ray radiation efficiency with respect to the total jet power is approximately 100%, the radiative efficiency of GeV-TeV neutrinos remains 0.1-10%. By contrast, when the gamma-ray radiation efficiency is relatively low (< 10%) for jets where a large fraction of the energy is dissipated below the photosphere, the neutrino efficiency can increase up to 20%. This suggests that GRBs with relatively low gamma-ray luminosities, as well as X-ray-rich transients, can be promising targets for ongoing and future GeV-TeV neutrino transient searches."}

We fit five XMM-Newton spectra of Fairall 9 using the hybrid reXcor model taking into account both hot and warm corona. The soft excess is explained by a combination of a physically motivated warm corona and the disc reflection. Then, we perform a wavelet coherence analysis of the light curves between 0.3 - 1 and 1 - 4 keV bands. The spectral fits are consistent with a rapidly spinning black hole ($a = 0.99$), a warm corona with optical depth $\\sim$10 - 30, and a hot lamp-post corona located at either 5 or $20~r_{\\rm g}$. This configuration supports a coexisting hot and warm corona scenario, allowing the disc to extend almost to the event horizon.

The earlier observations exhibit more variable and transient lag behavior. In contrast, the later observations display more persistent soft X-ray lags at the frequencies of $\\sim 9\\times 10^{-6}$ - $2.5 \\times 10^{-5}$ Hz, with amplitudes reaching $\\sim$1000 s.

In this paper, we present an analysis of the $\\approx$300-day TESS observation of a blazar 3C 371 using power spectrum density, structure-function, and weighted wavelet Z-transform approaches. To reduce the effect of gaps and noise, Continuous auto-regressive moving averages, Bartlett periodogram, and wavelet decomposition methods are used. We have also used recurrence analysis to account for the nonlinearity present in the data and to quantify variability or periodicity as the recurrent state. Considering the entirety of the TESS observations, we derive the variability timescale to be around 4.5 days. Sector-wise analysis found variability timescales in the range of 3.0--7.0 days, values that are found to be consistent using different methods. When analyzing multiple sectors together, significant variability, which could be quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), of duration 3--6 days in individual segments, is detected. These may be attributed to the kink instabilities developed in the jet or the existence of mini-jets inside a jet undergoing precession. We find that these methods, when applied appropriately, can be used to study the variability in TESS data. The noise present in these TESS observations can be minimized using Bartlett's periodogram and wavelet decomposition to recover the real stochastic variability."}

Compared with previous studies, we use more detailed models of the interstellar medium and the magneto-rotational evolution of neutron stars. We demonstrate that presently, the spin-down rate at the propeller stage is the main uncertain factor that influences the number of accreting isolated neutron stars. If the propeller stage duration allows neutron stars to begin accreting matter from the interstellar medium and if the efficiency of accretion is high, then the number of accreting isolated neutron stars in eROSITA data can reach ~a few thousand. Still, uncertainties in spin-down at the propeller stage and in the accretion process can drastically decrease this number. We suggest that future observations of neutron stars in wide low-mass binaries recently discovered by Gaia can clarify these issues."}

The joint detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves would provide insight into cosmic processes, such as progenitor dynamics and outflows. The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the observation when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Leveraging data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, we conducted an archival investigation of sub-threshold multimessenger events. Complementing previous analyses, we used minimal assumptions to search for common sources of sub-threshold gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrino candidates during the third observing run (O3) of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We therefore derive constraints on the rate density of joint sources for each compact binary merger population as a function of the energy emitted in neutrinos. Only a fraction of the gravitational-wave sources emit neutrinos, if the neutrino emission has high bolometric energy ($>10^{52}$ to $10^{54}$ erg)."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Upcoming space-based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, will be sensitive to extreme- and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs and IMRIs). These binaries are comprised of a supermassive black hole and a stellar-mass object or intermediate-mass black hole. Their detection will probe the structure of galactic nuclei and enable tests of general relativity. As these events will be observed over thousands of orbital cycles, they will be extremely sensitive to both the underlying spacetime and astrophysical environment, demanding exquisite theoretical models on both fronts to avoid biased or even erroneous results. In particular, many (E/)IMRIs are expected to occur within accretion discs around supermassive black holes, and the nonlinearities present when modeling these systems require numerical simulations. In preparation for future modeling of LISA sources, we have conducted a comparison between eight different hydrodynamical codes and applied them to the problem of a q = 10^{-4} mass ratio binary interacting with an accretion disc. Thicker discs appear more lenient, and all codes at sufficiently high resolutions are in good agreement with each other and analytical predictions. For thinner discs, beyond the reach of analytical models, we find substantial disagreement between 2D and 3D simulations and between different codes, including both the magnitude and sign of the torque. With time and energy efficiency in mind, codes that leverage moving meshes or grid-based Lagrangian remapping seem preferable, as do codes that can leverage graphical processing units and other energy-efficient hardware."}

Such spikes are unique targets, which provide a possibility to discover the basic thermal s-wave annihilating WIMP with any mass up to the theoretical unitarity limit ~ 100 TeV. All relevant SMBHs were checked, and only MW* and M31* were identified as worthwhile objects. Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) sensitivity to heavy WIMPs in M31* was estimated. It was obtained that CTA will be able to probe a major part of TeV-scale WIMP parameter space in case of optimistic spike density configuration in M31*. In certain scenarios, M31* may yield even stronger constraints than MW*. Relevant systematic uncertainties were explored."}
