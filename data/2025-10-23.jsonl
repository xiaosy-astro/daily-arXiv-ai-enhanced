General relativistic radiative transfer is employed to compute\nsynchrotron emission from thermal electrons and generate horizon-scale images.\nFor the RIAF model, we analyze the dependence of image morphology on the\ndeformation parameter, observing frequency, and flow dynamics. The photon ring\nand central dark region expand with increasing deformation parameter, with\nbrightness asymmetries arising at high inclinations and depending on flow\ndynamics and emission anisotropy. The BAAF disk produces narrower rings and\ndarker centers, while polarization patterns trace the brightness distribution\nand vary with viewing angle and deformation, revealing spacetime structure.\nThese results demonstrate that intensity and polarization in thick-disk models\nprovide probes of KZ black holes and near-horizon accretion physics."}

It is located at 0.2{\\deg} from PSR\nJ1740+1000, a radio and gamma-ray pulsar placed well above the Galactic plane,\nwhich displays an X-ray tail. Despite the offset, the association between the\ntwo sources is likely. We aim to study the diffuse X-ray emission around PSR\nJ1740+1000 and its tail to investigate the origin of 1LHAASO J1740+0948u\nthrough a multi-wavelength SED fitting, testing different scenarios. We\nanalysed ~500 ks of XMM-Newton observations and studied for the first time the\ndiffuse emission around the pulsar. We also analysed the tail and how its\nemission evolves as a function of distance. We then performed a fit of the SED,\nincluding the spectrum of 1LHAASO J1740+0948u and the X-ray data obtained from\neither the analysis of the tail or the diffuse emission, to understand whether\none of the two X-ray sources could be related to the TeV emission and attempt a\nsource classification. The diffuse X-ray emission analysis resulted in upper\nlimits in the 0.5-10 keV range. The tail is best fitted with a power law with\n$\\Gamma=1.76\\pm0.06$ in 0.5-8 keV, with no significant detection of spectral\nvariations with distance. We do not find a good SED fit that can explain both\nthe X-ray tail and the LHAASO spectrum with reasonable parameters, suggesting\nthat the TeV emission likely comes from an older X-ray-faint electron\npopulation. We then performed an SED fitting of the VHE spectrum combined with\nthe upper limits on the diffuse emission, constraining the magnetic field to be\nas low as $B\\leq1.2 \\mu$G. We suggest that 1LHAASO J1740+0948u could represent\neither the relic PWN of PSR J1740+1000 or its pulsar halo.

The gradients associated with these inhomogeneous\nplasma regions serve as free energy sources that can drive plasma\ninstabilities, including the lower-hybrid drift instability (LHDI). Notably,\nlower-hybrid waves are frequently observed in magnetized space plasma\nenvironments, such as Earth's magnetotail and magnetopause. Previous studies\nhave primarily focused on modeling particle acceleration via LHDI in these\nregions using a quasilinear approach. This study expands the investigation of\nLHDI to a broader range of environments, spanning weakly to strongly magnetized\nmedia, including interplanetary, interstellar, intergalactic, and intracluster\nplasmas. To explore the applicability of LHDI in various astrophysical\nsettings, we employ two key parameters: (1) plasma magnetization, characterized\nby the plasma beta parameter, and (2) the spectral slope of suprathermal\nelectrons following a power-law distribution. Using a quasilinear model, we\ndetermine the critical values of plasma beta and spectral slope that enable\nefficient electron acceleration via LHDI by comparing the rate of growth of\ninstability and the damping rate of the resulting fluctuations. We further\nanalyze the time evolution of the electron distribution function to confirm\nthese critical conditions. Our results indicate that electron acceleration is\ngenerally most efficient in low-beta plasmas ($\\beta < 1$). However, the\npresence of suprathermal electrons significantly enhances electron acceleration\nvia LHDI, even in high-beta plasmas ($\\beta > 1$).

Our analysis reveals that both types\nof flares exhibit similar morphological characteristics, with prompt flares\nbeing brighter and occurring earlier than afterglow flares. We find strong\ncorrelations between flare parameters, such as peak time, duration, and\nluminosity, which follow consistent patterns across both flare types.

Accepted for publication in Astronomy &\n  Astrophysics", "summary": "Numerous astrophysical shock waves evolve in an environment where the\nradiative cooling behind the shock affects the hydrodynamical structure\ndownstream, thereby influencing the potential for particle acceleration via\ndiffusive shock acceleration (DSA).\n  We study the possibility for DSA to energize particles from the thermal pool\nand from pre-existing cosmic rays at radiative shocks, focusing on the case of\nsupernova remnants (SNRs). We rely on a semi-analytical description of particle\nacceleration at collisionless shocks in the test-particle limit, estimating the\ntotal proton and electron content from SNRs throughout the radiative phase. Our\nresults indicate that DSA can lead to significant particle acceleration during\nthe first few tens of kyrs of the radiative phase. Although the associated\nmulti-wavelength emission from SNRs in the radiative phase may not be\ndetectable with current observatories in most cases, the radiative phase is\nfound to lead to substantial deviations from the canonical p$^{-4}$ of the\ntest-particle limit. The hardening/steepening is due to an interplay between a\ngrowing contribution of the reaccelerated term as the SNR volume expands and\nthe effects of adiabatic and radiative losses on trapped particles as particles\nare confined for a longer time. The slope of the cumulative proton and electron\nspectra over the SNR lifetime thus depends on the environment in which the SNR\nshock propagates, and on the duration of the radiative phase during which DSA\ncan take place. Overall, DSA in the radiative phase can lead to a total\nelectron spectrum steeper than the proton spectrum, both at SNRs from\nthermonuclear and core-collapse SNe. Finally, we comment on the case of young\nradiative SNRs (in the first month to a few years after the explosion) for\nwhich the denser environments (with mass-loss rates of $\\dot{M} \\sim 10^{-1} -\n1$ M$_{\\odot}$/yr) tend to inhibit DSA."}

We reveal signatures of the SN imprinted in the\nSNR morphology. We confirm the impact of a companion on the SNR: its presence\ninduces a conical shadow in the ejecta, that is long lived. Its intersection\nwith the shocked shell is visible in projection as a ring, an ellipse, or a\nbar, depending on the orientation. New, we test the case of a nested explosion\nmodel, in which the explosion of the primary induces the secondary to also\nexplode. As the explosion of the secondary WD is weaker only the primary outer\nejecta interact with the ambient medium and form the main SNR shell.
