With the upcoming Roman Space Telescope, scheduled for launch in 2026, a new and powerful channel for their detection - astrometric microlensing - will become available. We set out to create a realistic sample of simulated gravitational microlensing events as observed by Roman with the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey. We focus in particular on the population of NS lenses, which has until now been largely understudied. We use state-of-the-art Galactic models tailored for application to microlensing by compact objects. We simulate four different NS populations with Maxwellian natal kick distributions: $\\bar{v} = (150, \\ 250, \\ 350, \\ 450)$ km/s. We apply projected Roman precision, cadence, and detectability criteria. We find the parameter space $\\log_{10} t_{\\rm E}$ - $\\log_{10} θ_{\\rm E}$, which will be accessible to Roman observations, to be maximally efficient for classification of stellar remnants. We find a feature in this space that is characteristic to NS; using this feature, optimal samples of NS candidates can be constructed from Roman-like datasets. We describe the dependence of observable parameter distributions on the assumed mean kick velocities. As the effects of natal kicks are very complex and mutually counteracting, we suggest more detailed studies focused on the dynamics of NS are needed in anticipation of Roman and future surveys. We estimate Roman will observe approximately $11\\,000$ microlensing events - including $\\sim100$ with NS lenses - whose both photometric and astrometric signal are detectable; the event yield decreases by $38\\%$ if gap-filling low-cadence observations are not included. We make all simulated microlensing event datasets publicly available in preparation for Roman data."}

As part of the POLAMI program, we have conducted 14 years of 1 mm and 3 mm polarization monitoring of a sample of gamma-ray-bright blazars with the IRAM 30-m telescope, complemented here with long-term optical polarimetric observations from multiple facilities. We aim to test whether current models of parsec-scale jet physics are consistent with observed multi-band polarization behavior. Using a Bayesian framework, we derive intrinsic mean flux densities and modulation indices for total flux and fractional polarization, and characterize EVPA variability using circular statistics. We then examine how these quantities reflecting variability properties across millimeter and optical bands relate to synchrotron peak frequency, jet orientation, and radio/gamma-ray luminosities. BL Lac objects exhibit, on average, higher fractional polarization and lower EVPA variability than FSRQs at all wavelengths. Fractional polarization increases with frequency, consistent with increasingly ordered magnetic fields at shorter wavelengths. BL Lacs also show more frequent alignment of EVPAs between optical and millimeter bands, whereas FSRQs display weaker coherence. EVPA variability correlates positively with radio and gamma-ray luminosities and negatively with synchrotron peak frequency, most strongly in the optical. We further find a positive correlation between EVPA spread and fractional polarization variability, suggesting a direct link between magnetic-field structure and polarization dynamics."}

Both pipelines show performance and reliably recover injected transients with peak magnitudes $g<22$ AB mag with an efficiency of $97.24^{+0.7}_{-1.0}$ percent for \\texttt{dwf-postpipe} and $96.14^{+0.9}_{-1.1}$ percent for a difference imaging approach.

This corresponds to a radio efficiency upper limit of $ξ< 2.8 \\times 10^{-10}$, which is significantly lower than that of typical millisecond pulsars with a similar spin-down power. This profound radio pulsation faintness can be explained by two primary scenarios: either a geometric effect, wherein the pulsar's radio beam is directed away from our line of sight, or a physical suppression of the emission mechanism, potentially caused by a persistent low-level accretion flow during the X-ray quiescent state."}

We investigate the physics of black hole accretion flows, particularly focusing on phenomena like magnetic reconnection and plasmoid formation, which are believed to be responsible for energetic events such as flares observed from astrophysical black holes.Aims. We aim to understand the influence of radiative cooling on plasmoid formation within black hole accretion flows that are threaded by multi-loop magnetic field configurations.Methods. We conducted two- and three-dimensional two-temperature general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. By varying the magnetic loop sizes and the mass accretion rate, we explored how radiative cooling alters the accretion dynamics, disk structure, and the properties of reconnection-driven plasmoid chains.Results. Our results demonstrate that radiative cooling suppresses the transition to the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state by reducing magnetic flux accumulation near the horizon. It significantly modifies the disk morphology by lowering the electron temperature and compressing the disk, which leads to increased density at the equatorial plane and decreased magnetization. Within the current sheets, radiative cooling triggers layer compression and the collapse of plasmoids, shortening their lifetime and reducing their size, while the frequency of plasmoid events increases. Moreover, we observe enhanced negative energy-at-infinity density in plasmoids near the ergosphere, with its peaks corresponding to plasmoid presence.Conclusions. Radiative cooling plays a critical role in shaping both macroscopic accretion flow properties and microscopic reconnection phenomena near black holes. This suggests that radiative cooling may modulate black hole energy extraction through reconnection-driven Penrose processes, highlighting its importance in models of astrophysical black holes."}

It is a positive quantity and bounded by causality. It is defined as the rate of change of pressure with respect to the system's density. In this article, we derive a covariant equation for the sound wave and demonstrate how the wave equation is modified in the general relativistic formalism. One can then define an effective speed of sound by attenuating the usual definition of sound speed with the gravitational metric potential. The general relativistic curvature effect is observed to reduce the speed of sound when computed inside a neutron star. This effectively makes the star relatively softer (according to the equation of state). The change in the effective sound speed can be easily visualised if one redefines the non-radial modes in terms of it. The modes do not change, but the space-time curvature reduces the amplitude of the oscillation modes. The formalism is suited for studying astrophysical compact objects."}

We conducted extensive searches to identify such untriggered transient events observed with GBM in 11 years (July 2010 - June 2021). In particular, we employed four different search modes with various energy ranges (mainly below 300 keV) and time resolutions (from 8 ms to 2 s), utilizing three statistical methods (signal-to-noise ratio, Poisson, and Bayesian statistics), each with different effectiveness in identifying specific classes of transients. Moreover, we developed algorithms for known-event flagging as well as unknown-event classification for our candidate events found in the searches. In this paper, we present our search methodologies, event flagging and classification algorithms and the resulting comprehensive event catalog. The catalog contains more than a million events in total, including known events such as gamma-ray bursts, soft-gamma repeater bursts, galactic X-ray source activities, terrestrial gamma flashes, and solar flares. For each candidate event, the catalog presents the event time, detection significance, event duration, hardness ratios, known-event flagging results, and classification probabilities. Our short-transient catalog significantly expands the currently-existing list of known events and complements the GBM trigger catalog.

From pulsar radio observation, it is seen that a couple of pulsars reveal new emission components at higher radio frequencies, although they show single-component emission at lower frequencies. We develop a brief outline, fostering inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of the low-frequency radio photons as a vulnerable source of scattering, susceptible to explaining the evolution of new components of some radio pulsars at higher bands. We couple the conventional curvature radiation (CR) mechanism and ICS, and suggest that the spectral convolution of the flux component individually from CR and the modulated template due to the ICS scattered component can be combined to reproduce such signatures associated with the diverse morphology of the integrated pulse profile. We reproduce the beam frequency diagram, the geometrical variation of different parameters of the emission geometry, as well as the multi-frequency evolution from theory. We have suitably tuned the input parameter space and given the combination of parameters that can tune to a particular scattered frequency in tabulated form. We conclude that ICS may be a responsible process for describing the emergence of new components in higher radio emission bands."}

Within a 1D Gaussian plasma-lens framework, we show that small, monotonic variations in the incidence angle of the FRB wavefront naturally generate both downward and upward sub-burst frequency drifts. We further demonstrate that distinct lensed paths that probe different rotation measures (RMs), can produce orthogonal polarization-angle (PA) jumps at gigahertz frequencies.

The chromatic activity of FRB 20180916B-earlier and narrower activity windows at higher frequencies-can be explained as preferential magnification near the outer caustic. Finally, the intrinsic resolution of a plasma lens provides an upper limit on the transverse emission size: lenses located close to the source yield magnetospheric-scale constraints and offer a practical means of discriminating between inner- and outer-magnetospheric emission scenarios. These results suggest that plasma lensing could account for multiple complex observational features of FRBs and may play a non-negligible role in modulating their observable properties."}

This black-hole-envelope configuration facilitates efficient photohadronic interactions and neutrino production. Remarkably, their observed source number density and luminosity are compatible with the energetics of the diffuse neutrino background. We consider that relativistic jets and outflows are launched from the black hole and propagate through low-density polar funnels within envelopes, where particle acceleration and neutrino emission occur.

By deriving exact analytical solutions for two-flavor evolution in red turbulent matter-where correlations grow as $t^{|ν|}$-we uncover a novel acceleration of coherence loss. This dynamical decoherence mechanism raises an effective energy barrier against the collective growth of flavor instabilities. Translating our master-equation results into an effective damping rate for FFC linear analysis, we find that realistic red turbulence ($ν\\sim -1$, fluctuation strength $ξ_ν\\sim 0.1$) can elevate the FFC threshold by a factor of $\\sim 3-5$, potentially stabilizing regions that would otherwise undergo explosion-killing flavor equilibration (or vice versa).
