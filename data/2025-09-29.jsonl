These\ninteractions can completely disintegrate a nucleus of iron over trajectory\nlengths of a few and up to hundreds of megaparsecs, depending on the energy of\nthe UHECR. The stochastic nature of these interactions means that it is not\npossible to describe them deterministically for a single cosmic ray, and an\nexact formulation of the probability distributions is not yet available.\nCurrent approaches describe these interactions using either Monte Carlo\nsimulations or solving ordinary differential equations that neglect\nstochasticity. Because of the limitations of these approaches, only partial\ncapture of the process is achieved. This paper presents an analytic\nprobabilistic description of UHECR interactions and the resulting nuclear\ncascades, establishing their connection to Markov jump processes. The\nfundamental properties of these cascades are presented, as is the computation\nof the usual quantities of interest, such as the horizon, spectrum, and\ncomposition. The benefits of this description are outlined using astrophysical\nexamples related to extragalactic propagation and UHECR sources."}

Photons traversing\nmagnetized regions can convert into ALPs, producing characteristic,\nenergy-dependent absorption features in astrophysical spectra. The probability\nof such conversions depends sensitively on both the photon energy and the\nproperties of the intervening magnetic fields.\n  Most existing searches have focused on individual astrophysical sources, but\nuncertainties in the structure and strength of cosmic magnetic fields have\nlimited their reach. Recently, we have demonstrated that active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs) observed through galaxy clusters provide especially promising targets\nfor ALP searches. By stacking multiple AGN-cluster sightlines, one can average\nover poorly known magnetic field configurations in galaxy clusters and recover\na distinctive ALP-induced spectral suppression, thereby significantly enhancing\nsensitivity.\n  In this work, we investigate a possible systematic uncertainty in such\nanalyses: the intrinsic time-variability of AGN spectra. We demonstrate that\nAGN flux variability is correlated with spectral hardness, and that\ntime-averaging over flaring and quiescent states can potentially mimic the\nsuppression features imprinted by ALP-photon mixing. Our findings imply that\nthe recent constraints remain conservative, and that incorporating detailed\nspectral variability into stacking analyses can further sharpen the search for\naxion-like particles."}

In both general\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations as well as simplified\nmodels of the black hole magnetosphere, the polarization angle, quantified by\nthe complex observable arg(beta_2), depends strongly and systematically on the\nblack hole spin. This relationship arises from the coupling between spin and\nthe structure of the magnetic field in the emission region, and it can be\ncomputed analytically in the force-free limit. To explore this connection\nfurther, we develop a semi-analytic inflow framework that solves the time\nstationary axisymmetric equations of GRMHD in the black hole's equatorial\nplane; this model can interpolate between the force-free and inertial regimes\nby varying the magnetization of the inflow. Our model demonstrates how finite\ninertia modifies the structure of the electromagnetic field and can be used to\nquantitatively predict the observed polarization pattern. By comparing reduced\nmodels, GRMHD simulations, and analytic limits, we show that the observed\nsynchrotron polarization can serve as a robust diagnostic of spin under\nassumptions about Faraday rotation and the emission geometry. Applied to EHT\ndata, the model disfavors high-spin configurations for both M87* and Sgr A*,\nhighlighting the potential of polarimetric imaging as a probe of both black\nhole spin and near-horizon plasma physics."}
