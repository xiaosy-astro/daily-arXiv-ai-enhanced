Submitted to ApJ. Reproducibility package for data and figures at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18615967. Comments are welcome!", "summary": "The catalog of Gravitational Wave (GW) events is rapidly growing, providing key insights into the evolution of massive binaries and compact object formation. However, a key challenge is to explain the origin of exceptional events such as GW190814, among the most asymmetric mass-ratio mergers to date ($q\\approx 0.1$). We show that it shares an evolutionary pathway with the most unequal mass Galactic High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) 4U 1700-37/ HD 153919. We demonstrate this unique connection by utilizing a rich set of existing observational constraints for the HMXB and compute detailed binary evolution models to explain its formation history. We find that conservative mass transfer, along with a directed natal kick are essential to explain its current state. We show that this system is unlikely to form a GW source due to a failed Common Envelope (CE) phase in the future, in agreement with previous work. With additional models, we show that a similar pathway naturally forms GW190814-like events, provided the first phase of mass transfer remains conservative, and the first-born (lower mass) compact object receives a large natal kick ($\\gtrsim 100\\,\\mathrm{km/s}$) for the subsequent CE phase to be successful and form a asymmetric mass-ratio GW source. Anchored by the number of analogous Galactic HMXBs, we estimate rates for such GW events, which broadly agree with their observed rate. Our work demonstrates a unified formation pathway for highly asymmetric mass-ratio HMXBs and GW events. Moreover, it highlights the critical role of finding and characterizing local analogs in different evolutionary phases, and using them as a bridge to understand the origin of GW sources, especially the outliers like GW190814."}

Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are rare transients that provide important insights into the physics of galactic nuclei. A recently identified feature in their optical light curves is the presence of early bump-like structures (precursors) that appear before the onset of the main flare or during its rise. Aims. We aim to build and study the first sample of precursor TDEs in order to improve our understanding of these features, which could be key to revealing the origin of the optical emission in TDEs. Methods. We compiled all known precursor TDEs from the literature, searched for additional candidates, and analyzed them as a sample. Results. We find that precursor TDEs predominantly fall within the repeating TDE, fast TDE, and TDE in active galactic nucleus (AGN) subclasses. We reveal a positive correlation between the occurrence time of the precursors relative to the main peak and the central black hole mass. Conclusions. We suggest that the precursors appear due to interactions between the incoming stellar debris and the disk or leftover material from an earlier disruption (repeating and fast TDEs) or a stable pre-existing disk (TDEs in AGNs). Precursors are therefore potentially key signatures of repeating partial TDEs in previously quiescent galaxies."}

However, standard analyses typically rely on \\emph{ad hoc} hotspot parameterizations rather than self-consistent physical models. While connecting surface heating directly to the magnetospheric geometry provides a more natural physical pathway, computing global magnetospheric solutions is too computationally expensive to perform on-the-fly during parameter inference. In this work, we bridge this gap by deriving fully analytic, first-principles expressions for surface return currents in mixed dipole--quadrupole magnetospheres. Working within force-free electrodynamics, we generalize the field-aligned current invariant $Λ$, the crucial scalar that maps the far-zone magnetic structure to the near-zone heating rate, from the standard dipole approximation to arbitrary quadrupolar configurations. We demonstrate that even when the quadrupole component is sub-dominant in the far zone (the mixing regime), using a dipole-based heating prescription fails to capture the significant enhancement or suppression of the return-current density on the polar cap. Our consistent quadrupole-aware framework reveals that these multipolar currents redistribute the surface heating, leading to systematic discrepancies in predicted pulse profiles that are amplified by atmosphere beaming and can reach $\\sim 30\\%$ near pulse peaks. These results provide a rigorous analytic foundation for mapping global magnetic geometry to surface heating in multipolar magnetospheres, enabling physically consistent inference beyond the idealized dipole approximation."}

The mechanism requires strong magnetic fields in the upstream plasma entering the reconnection layer, and weaker, but still substantial, magnetic fields in the downstream regions. In this Letter, we estimate the coronal magnetic fields for three different magnetic energy dissipation mechanisms: plasmoid-dominated magnetic reconnection, fast collisionless reconnection, and magnetic field relaxation. We show that the lack of strong Faraday depolarization constrains viable models and can be used to benchmark numerical accretion flow models. We conclude by discussing the difficulties of disentangling the various effects that can depolarize the signals from BHXRBs at low energies. We furthermore emphasize that Faraday rotation is unlikely to play a role in the polarization of the coronal X-ray emission of active galactic nuclei."}

The NuSTAR observation captured the source near the outburst peak, while AstroSat observed it during the decay phase. Coherent pulsations at $\\sim$401 Hz were detected throughout the outburst, with the fundamental amplitude in the 3--30 keV range increasing from $\\sim$4% near the peak to $\\sim$6% during the decay. The pulsations display strong energy dependence and negative time lags of $\\sim$0.2--0.3 ms, with harder photons leading softer ones. The broadband spectra in both epochs are well described by a soft thermal component and Comptonized continuum, together with a prominent relativistic reflection component. As the outburst evolved, the continuum softened ($Γ$ increasing from $\\sim$1.88 to $\\sim$1.99) and the coronal electron temperature decreased ($kT_{\\rm e}$ from $\\sim$31 to $\\sim$18 keV), consistent with enhanced Compton cooling at lower accretion rates. The ionization parameter declined ($\\log ξ$ from $\\sim$3.4 to $\\sim$1.8) while the reflection fraction increased, suggesting a changing accretion geometry with a more compact corona and a larger disk covering fraction during the decay phase. The X-ray luminosity decreased by a factor of $\\sim$3 between the two epochs. Our results suggest the coupled evolution of the corona, disk, and magnetosphere as the mass accretion rate declines."}

We employ new neutron capture rates from cross sections calculated with Yet Another Hauser-Feshbach Code ($\\texttt{YAHFC}$) using an uncertainty-quantified Koning-Delaroche potential modified for use on neutron-rich systems. Using these rates as a baseline, we perform Monte-Carlo studies with independent rate variations (uncorrelated Monte Carlo) and find correlations between specific neutron capture rates and the resulting elemental abundances for the three weak r-process scenarios: two separate simulations of neutron star merger remnant accretion disks and a simulation of a magnetorotational supernova. We discuss the underlying nuclear dynamics that give rise to these correlations and the role of astrophysical conditions in them. We demonstrate how reducing the uncertainty in these rates would improve the prospects for conducting precision $\\textit{r}$-process studies in the future. We additionally present a correlated Monte Carlo study, which incorporates the full covariance matrix that describes the relationships between individual neutron capture rates that arise from an uncertainty-quantified optical potential. We find that the magnitude of the uncertainty in the abundance pattern is similar to that produced by an uncorrelated Monte Carlo that employs only the on-diagonal components of the covariance matrix. We show how correlations restructure how the abundances co-vary, but do not necessarily decrease the overall uncertainty envelope."}

However, the efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is expected to be reduced in the low-Mach-number, weakly turbulent environments characteristic of cluster merger shocks, and recent results suggest that DSA itself may not constitute a viable physical mechanism. In this work, we investigate ballistic surfing acceleration (BSA) as an electrodynamically grounded mechanism for electron energization that does not rely on prescribed diffusion coefficients. We formulate BSA under typical cluster shock conditions and derive the balance between coherent acceleration by the shock convection electric field and radiative losses due to synchrotron and inverse-Compton cooling. This balance determines both the maximum electron energy and the resulting steady-state spectrum. By forward-modeling the associated synchrotron emission and comparing it with integrated radio observations of the Sausage and Toothbrush relics, we find that the observed spectral curvature and high-frequency steepening can be reproduced when only a very small fraction ($\\sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-8}$) of the available BSA acceleration capacity contributes to systematic electron energization. Despite this extremely small efficiency, it is sufficient to accelerate electrons to Lorentz factors $γ\\sim 10^4 - 10^5$ under cluster conditions. These results suggest that radio relics provide a promising astrophysical laboratory for probing coherent acceleration, and that the BSA framework may account for the production of relativistic electrons in cluster shocks."}

Thanks to its high energy resolution, Resolve enables us to measure fine structures of highly ionized emission lines from Si to Fe and to directly determine the excitation temperature and the ionization temperature from the emission line ratio diagnostics. The observed spectrum in the Centaurus core is well-represented by a double-temperature thermal plasma at collisional ionization equilibrium state rather than an isothermal one. The line ratio diagnostics also support this biphasic temperature structure. Particularly, the observed line ratios show a trend of increasing ionization temperature with atomic mass, while the ionization and excitation temperatures of Fe show nearly the same temperature. The resultant line ratios, which are well-represented by the two temperatures ICM, ~ 1.6 and ~ 3 keV, are also fairly consistent with the expected numbers when assuming the radial single-temperature ICM was projected in the cluster core along the line of sight. Due to the limited low-energy sensitivity of the Resolve with the gate valve closed, we investigated the effect of the cool component using the XMM-Newton/RGS spectrum, but it ultimately did not affect our results. The observed flux ratio between the Fe XXV He alpha resonance and forbidden lines shows an about 20% reduction, suggesting the presence of resonant scattering."}

These constraints provided by the IceCube detector have been instrumental in investigating the properties of the GRB jet and its emission models. During the prompt phase of gamma ray burst emission, intense radiation components are generated that interact with the shock-accelerated particles within the jet. We study various GRB emission models, such as the internal shock model, the photospheric models, and also include a model-independent case. Based on these models, we calculate the neutrino fluence using the photo-hadronic interaction process. We estimate the bulk Lorentz factor using the well-known correlations between prompt phase observables, which is then used to calculate the emission site for the model-dependent scenarios. For GRB 221009A, we find that a low baryon loading scenario is consistent with the IceCube upper limits; however, for GRB 240825A, a higher value of baryon loading is preferred. Also, the values of the microphysical parameters $ε_e$ and $ε_B$ for GRB 240825A are lower by factors of approximately 10 and 100, respectively, compared to those of GRB 221009A. Further, using neutrino upper limits for these two sources, we estimate the lower limits on the dissipation radius for our models. The current TeV PeV upper limits for GRB 221009A are already useful for constraining parameter space for the BPH and MPH models."}

Accepted for publication in Physical Review D", "summary": "Fermi LAT observations of gamma-ray pulsars can be used to build a pulsar timing array (PTA) experiment to search for gravitational wave (GW) signals at nanohertz frequencies. At those frequencies, the dominant signal is expected to be a stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) produced by the incoherent superposition of the quasi-monochromatic GW emissions from a population of supermassive black hole binaries. While the radio PTAs have recently announced compelling evidence for a GWB signal with a power law spectrum of strain amplitude $\\approx2-3\\times10^{-15}$ (at the frequency of $1 {\\rm yr}^{-1}$), in 2022 an analysis of $12.5$ years of Fermi data for 35 pulsars led to an upper limit of $1\\times10^{-14}$ for the GWB amplitude. The analysis was carried out on times-of-arrival (TOAs) obtained by folding from six months up to one year of photon observations. A photon-by-photon approach was also tested to infer constraints on the GWB amplitude from individual pulsars, but without accounting for the cross-pulsar correlations that a GWB would induce. Here, we reanalyse the same dataset using a regularized likelihood method that correctly models cross-pulsar correlations directly from the photons, while additionally marginalising over the uncertain pulse profile shape. While the two methods are not expected to have significant differences in sensitivity, we prove through simulations of gamma-ray PTA datasets that the photon-by-photon method for GWB recoveries is, statistically, more robust. The resulting upper limit obtained for the GWB strain amplitude is $1.2\\times10^{-14}$, indicating that the improved method yields a consistent result with the previous analyses."}
