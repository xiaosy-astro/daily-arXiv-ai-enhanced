We\nstrengthen the claim that, according to the JJEM, there are no failed CCSNe and\nthat all massive stars explode. In demonstrating the robust convection in the\ninner core of stripped-envelope CCSN progenitors, we add to the establishment\nof the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe."}

Relative to canonical\nyoung pulsars, CCOs are spinning down at a very slow rate $|\\dot f| <10^{-15}$\ns$^{-2}$, implying a surface dipole magnetic field strength $B_s < 10^{11}$ G\nthat is too weak to account for their X-ray emitting hot spots. Two CCO pulsars\nwith sufficiently long monitoring, 1E 1207.4$-$5209 and PSR J0821$-$4300, are\nseen to deviate from steady spin-down; their timing residuals can be modeled by\none or more glitches in $f$ and $\\dot f$, or alternatively by extreme timing\nnoise. For the third CCO pulsar, PSR J1852+0400, the sparse temporal coverage\nwas insufficient to detect such effects. Glitch activity and timing noise in\nlarge samples of rotation-powered pulsars correlate best with $\\dot f$, while\nthe timing irregularities of the first two CCOs are extreme compared to pulsars\nof the same $\\dot f$. Nevertheless, timing activity in CCOs may arise from\nproperties that they share with other young but more energetic pulsars: high\ninternal temperature, strong buried magnetic field and superfluid behavior.\nAlternatively, continuing low-level accretion of supernova debris is not ruled\nout as a source of timing noise in CCOs."}

Long-term radio-monitoring at\nthe Owens Valley Radio Observatory has revealed two potential SMBHB candidates:\nblazars PKS 2131-021 and PKS J0805-0111. These sources show periodic flux\ndensity variations across the electromagnetic spectrum, signaling the presence\nof a good clock. To explain the emission, we propose a generalizable jet model,\nwhere a mildly relativistic wind creates an outward-moving helical channel,\nalong which the ultra-relativistic jet propagates. The observed flux variation\nfrom the jet is mostly due to aberration. The emission at lower frequency\narises at larger radius and its variation is consequently delayed, as observed.\nOur model reproduces the main observable features of both sources and can be\napplied to other sources as they are discovered. We make predictions for radio\npolarization, direct imaging, and emission line variation, which can be tested\nwith forthcoming observations. Our results motivate future numerical\nsimulations of jetted SMBHB systems and have implications for the fueling,\nstructure, and evolution of blazar jets."}
