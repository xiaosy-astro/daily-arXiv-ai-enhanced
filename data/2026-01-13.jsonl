Since then, they have been recognised as a common, perhaps ubiquitous, feature of accretion discs in X-ray binaries. Over the past two decades, our understanding of these outflows has expanded significantly, with their associated phenomenology now observed across the X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared regimes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the observational properties of both low- and high-ionisation winds, treating each separately as well as part of a broader phenomenon, and place these findings in the context of current theoretical modelling. We discuss their close connection with disc atmospheres, their impact on the accretion process, and their role within the broader framework that includes the radio jet and the different accretion flow configurations and states. We also address current challenges and outline some of the anticipated developments, particularly those linked to upcoming observational facilities."}

While their photometric properties (luminosity and duration) both span an order of magnitude, population studies suggest that these distributions are continuous. However, spectroscopic samples have shown some indications of distinct sub-types, either through similarity to certain prototype objects, or in terms of their velocity evolution. Here we show that a well-observed SLSN, PTF12dam, completely changes its O II absorption profile as it rises to maximum light, moving from one proposed sub-type to another. This supports an interpretation where spectroscopic diversity is driven by the ejecta temperature at maximum light, rather than fundamental differences in the explosion or progenitor. Motivated by this, we develop a new diagnostic, the Brightness-Timescale-Temperature-Radius diagram, and a simple toy model for the evolution of the photospheric velocity, to show that diversity in the light curve rise time (likely due to differences in ejected mass) naturally explains why SLSNe with broader light curves generally have weaker O II lines, lower photospheric velocities after maximum, and slower changes in photospheric velocity over time. We show that the velocity distribution of the known SLSN population favours a relatively flat ejecta density profile, consistent with a hot bubble inflated by a central engine."}

In the former scenario, cosmic-ray spectra throughout the Galaxy would be similar to that observed in the solar neighborhood, and the knee would be a common feature of the cosmic-ray sea. In the latter scenario, the PeV cosmic-ray flux varies across the Galactic disk, and the knee is dominantly contributed by a small number of nearby sources. By simulating cosmic-ray propagation in the Galactic magnetic field and interstellar medium, we show that the two scenarios correspond to different regimes of the birth rate of PeV proton accelerators and depend on the presence of powerful nearby sources. By comparison with both cosmic-ray and gamma-ray observations, we find that a local knee would be best explained by sources located at distances of order $\\sim1$ kpc and with ages in the range 0.1-1 Myr, with the Cygnus Cocoon being a particularly promising candidate."}

Recent observations have linked a few tidal disruption events (TDEs) to the production of high-energy neutrino emission, all of which display dust-reprocessed infrared flares, indicating a dust- and gas-rich environment. By cross-matching the neutrino events and a sample of mid-infrared outbursts in nearby galaxies with transient radio flares, we uncover an optically obscured TDE candidate, SDSS J151345.75 $+$ 311125.2, which shows both spatial and temporal coincidence with the sub-PeV neutrino event IC170514B. Using a standard equipartition analysis of the synchrotron spectral evolution spanning 605 days post mid-infrared discovery, we find a little evolution in the radio-emitting region, with a kinetic energy up to $10^{51}$ erg, depending on the outflow geometry and shock acceleration efficiency assumed. High-resolution European VLBI Network imaging reveals a compact radio emission that is unresolved at a scale of $<$ 2.1 pc, with a brightness temperature of $T_b>5\\times10^6$ K, suggesting that the observed late-time radio emission might originate from the interaction between a decelerating outflow and a dense circumnuclear medium. If the association is genuine, the neutrino production is possibly related to the acceleration of protons through pp collisions during the outflow expanding process, implying that the outflow-cloud interaction could provide a physical site with a high-density environment for producing the sub-PeV neutrinos. Such a scenario can be tested with future identifications of radio transients coincident with high-energy neutrinos."}

Deshpande", "Pankaj Jain"], "title": "Probing the morphology of the Gum Nebula through pulsar observables and a novel distance estimation method", "comment": "Accepted for publication in MNRAS, 10 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "Various existing models of the Gum Nebula differ significantly in their parameters and suggested origins, which can be independently tested for consistency with data on some key observables of pulsars in the direction of the nebula. Our analysis of such data on the Vela pulsar, assuming a dominant scattering region in its foreground, suggests that the fractional distance of the scatterer is $0.89 \\pm 0.01$, and for the given distance of the Vela pulsar, it translates to $254 \\pm 16$ pc. Using independent distances of ten pulsars, we suggest a refined description of the Gum Nebula electron density model with its basic morphology similar to that used in the YMW16 model, which now provides better estimates of pulsar distances in these directions. In our new Gum Nebula model, as expected, the Vela pulsar would be behind the frontal edge of the Gum shell, which was intriguingly located in front of the nebula in the YMW16 model. We also present a new technique to better constrain the pulsar distances using their dispersion measure and temporal broadening simultaneously, and find that it is less affected by the uncertainties in the Galactic electron density distribution models. Notably, the new approach shows that the expected temporal broadening as a function of trial distance does not follow a monotonic increasing trend, but instead exhibits oscillations at regions of enhanced electron density. This behaviour is expected, as the method employs the integral form of temporal broadening with the appropriate weighting kernel, leading to more reliable estimates."}

Here, we demonstrate that an off-axis minor merger in its early phase $-$ when the infalling subhalo is near its primary apocenter and the stripped tail is not yet mixed with the main cluster atmosphere $-$ can drive intracluster gas motions generally consistent with the XRISM results. These include a pronounced velocity gradient and an approximately uniform velocity dispersion of $\\simeq100-200\\,\\rm{km\\,s^{-1}}$ in the cluster core. Our merger scenario was originally suggested in Lyskova et al. (2019) to reproduce the major X-ray morphological features of Coma. In addition, we introduce a simple and robust diagnostic of intracluster gas motions based on the ratio of the line-of-sight velocity to the velocity dispersion."}

Although the analysis does not require an explicit reconstruction of the shower maximum ($X_{max}$), the discrimination power still arises from the sensitivity of the radio observables to the longitudinal development of the extensive air shower (EAS). Such radio-based approaches could be particularly relevant for radio-only experiments, such as GRAND. To assess this feasibility, we obtained conservative upper limits for the discrimination accuracy using a supervised machine-learning (ML) algorithm, namely a random forest (RF). The input features used were the peak electric fields and the spectral slopes, which have complementary discrimination power, along with the antenna distances to the shower axis. The RF was trained and tested using large event sets generated by the fast radio emission simulation and simplified detector response implemented in the RDSim framework. We obtained discrimination accuracies between 81\\% and 96\\% over the studied zenith range, even after normalizing each shower by its own electromagnetic energy. Since the analysis includes deliberately conservative choices, such as a large 10\\% uncertainty on the reconstructed EM energy, these quoted values should be interpreted as conservative upper limits suitable for a feasibility assessment. Our results demonstrate that event-by-event primary mass discrimination using radio observables is, in principle, feasible."}

Power spectral density (PSD) studies show breaks at specific frequencies, particularly in X-rays, linked to the accretion regime and black hole mass. However, very-high-energy gamma-ray PSD breaks remain unexplored due to current instrument limitations. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), with up to ten times greater sensitivity compared to current generation instruments, will allow precise PSD reconstruction and unprecedented study of blazar flares. These flares reveal key insights into particle acceleration, photon production, and jet properties. The AGN monitoring and flare programs in CTAO's Key Science Project aim to deepen our understanding of blazar emissions."}
