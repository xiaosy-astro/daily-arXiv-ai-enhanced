Pessah"], "title": "On the Evolution of Disk-Embedded Binaries: Framing Local Models in Global Context", "comment": null, "summary": "The disks of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have in recent years been\nrecognized as possible sites for gravitational wave sources, leading to a\nseries of numerical studies on the evolution of disk-embedded black hole\nbinaries. The majority of these works have been carried out so far using the\nshearing box, a local Cartesian domain co-rotating with the binary\ncenter-of-mass around the supermassive black hole. The local nature of this\nframework allows for focusing computational power close to the binary at the\nexpense of detaching the gas flow around the binary from the global dynamics.\nIn this paper, we provide a framework to assess the applicability of the\nshearing box for studying the long-term evolution of the orbital elements of\nthe embedded binary in viscous hydrodynamic disks. We accomplish this by\nidentifying the conditions under which relevant global timescales are longer\nthan the gas-induced evolution timescale of the embedded binary across various\nAGN disk models. For black hole masses of interest, we report the existence of\nradii beyond which the global influence of the disk may be reasonably\nneglected, supporting the use of the shearing box. More generally, we introduce\na systematic approach to link local simulations with the global problem they\naim to approximate while providing a way to gauge their accuracy. This will\nprove to be essential as we seek to add additional physics, such as magnetic\nfields and radiative transport, to develop more realistic models for black hole\nbinary mergers and their potential electromagnetic signatures in AGN disks."}

Using 45 two-dimensional\nsimulations for three different EoS compatible with the current tight\nconstraints, we show that the EoS remains a major uncertainty for the outcome\nof core-collapse supernovae. Whereas explosions are obtained in most cases for\nthe SFHo and SFHx EoS, for the CMF EoS, which includes a crossover from\nnucleonic matter to a quark phase, explosions occur only for 2 out of 15\nprogenitors. Less favourable conditions for neutrino-driven explosions arise\nfor the CMF EoS due to lower neutrino luminosities and mean energies and\nslightly weaker contraction of the warm proto-neutron star. Our results suggest\nthat the explodability of massive stars cannot yet be predicted based on first\nprinciples without better knowledge of the nuclear EoS. Conversely,\nobservational constraints on stellar explodability may help further constrain\nthe EoS."}

We present an analysis of the first\nXRISM/Resolve spectrum of the Seyfert-1 galaxy Mrk 279, known for its complex\nline profiles and variability. The data reveal velocity components within the\nFe K$_{\\alpha}$ emission line that can be associated with the inner face of the\nmolecular torus ($r \\geq 10^{4}~GM/c^{2})$, the broad line region (BLR; $r =\n1650^{+5780}_{-1480}~GM/c^{2}$), and the inner accretion disk ($r =\n81^{+280}_{-75}~GM/c^{2}$). We find evidence of low-velocity, highly ionized\ngas that contributes an H-like Fe XXVI emission line at 6.97 keV, confirming\nsuggestions from prior low-resolution spectra. The data do not show slow winds\nin absorption, but two pairs of lines - consistent with He-like and H-like Fe\nshifted by $v\\simeq 0.22c$ and $v\\simeq 0.33c$ - improve the fit, and could\nrepresent an ultra-fast outflow (UFO).

At the final stage of the evolution of such\nsystems, the low-mass neutron star fills its Roche lobe, whereupon its mass is\ngradually transferred to the more massive component. At a certain point, the\nstability of the mass transfer is lost, causing the minimum-mass neutron star\nto explode. In the present stripping calculations, the effect of\nnon-conservative mass transfer has been taken into account for the first time,\nresulting in an increase in the duration of stable mass transfer from a few\ntenths of a second to a few seconds. This allows the time delay of 1.7 s\nbetween the loss of the gravitational-wave signal and the detection of the\ngamma-ray burst from the multimessenger event GW170817-GRB170817A to be\nnaturally explained.

Previous works have performed searches for counterpart candidates in\ntransient catalogs and have identified active galactic nuclei (AGN) flares\ncoincident with GW events; existing theory predicts that such flares may arise\nfrom the interaction of the merger remnant with the embedding accretion disk\nenvironment. We apply a statistical formalism to measure the significance of\ncoincidence for the catalog as a whole, measuring that less than 3\\% (90\\%\ncredible interval) of LVK BBH mergers give rise to observable AGN flares. This\nresult still allows up to $\\sim 40\\%$ of BBH mergers to originate in AGN disks.\nWe also examine the individual coincidences of each merger/flare pairing,\ndetermining that in all cases the flares are more likely to belong to a\nbackground population of flares not associated with GW events. Our results are\nconsistent with theoretical predictions accounting for the observability of EM\ncounterparts in AGN disks, as well as based on the fact that the most massive\nAGNs (such as those included in the search) are not expected to harbor the\nmajority of the BBHs.
