VHE dataset was complied\nwith the datasets of other wavelengths in between the timescale of 1.7 to 4\nhours to construct the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). In\nprevious studies of GRB~160821B, synchrotron and external Compton (EC) model\ncould explain the VHE emission better than the synchrotron and synchrotron\nself-Compton (SSC) model.
