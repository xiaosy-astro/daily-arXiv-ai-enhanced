If the shock upstream is optically thick, radiation smoothens the velocity discontinuity at the shock (radiation-mediated shocks). However, in mildly magnetized outflows, a collisionless subshock can form, enhancing the efficiency of particle acceleration. We solve the hydrodynamic equations of a steady-state, radiation-mediated shock together with the radiative transfer equations accounting for electron and proton acceleration. Our goal is to explore the impact of the magnetic field and non-thermal radiation on the shock structure and the resulting spectral distribution of photons. To this purpose, we assume a relativistic upstream fluid velocity ($Γ_u = 10$) and investigate shock configurations with variable upstream magnetization ($σ_u = 0$, $10^{-8}$, $10^{-4}$, $0.1$, and $0.3$). We find that synchrotron self-absorption alters the shock profile for $σ_u \\gtrsim 10^{-8}$, with resulting changes up to $100\\%$ in the bulk Lorentz factor at the shock; for $σ_u \\gtrsim 0.1$, a prominent subshock forms. The spectral energy distributions of upstream- and downstream-going photons are also altered. Radiative processes linked to accelerated protons are responsible for a high-energy ($\\gtrsim 10$ GeV) tail in the photon spectrum; however, the radiation flux and pressure are negligibly affected with consequent minor impact on the shock structure. Our work highlights the importance of coupling the shock hydrodynamics to the transport of photons, electrons, protons, and intermediate particles to forecast the multi-messenger emission from astrophysical transients."}

Here, we introduce, for the first time, cross sections for proton impact on H$_2$, calculated using the semi-classical implementation of the molecular convergent close-coupling method. Our findings show that proton-induced H$_2$ excitation is comparable in magnitude to that caused by electrons. We discuss the possible implications on the estimate of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate from observations in the near-infrared domain and on the cosmic-ray-induced H$_2$ ultraviolet luminescence.

The evolution and properties of two type Ia supernovae in the Virgo cluster", "comment": "24 pages, 21 figures, 7 tables. Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are among the most precise cosmological distance indicators used to study the expansion history of the Universe. The vast increase of SN Ia data due to large-scale astrophysical surveys has led to the discovery of a wide variety of SN Ia sub-classes, such as transitional and fast-declining SNe Ia. However, their distinct photometric and spectroscopic properties differentiate them from the population of normal SNe Ia such that their use as cosmological tools remains challenged. Here, we present a high-cadenced photometric and spectroscopic dataset of two SNe Ia, SNe 2020ue and 2020nlb, which were discovered in the nearby Virgo cluster of galaxies. Our study shows that SN 2020nlb is a normal SN Ia whose unusually red color is intrinsic, arising from a lower photospheric temperature rather than interstellar reddening, providing clear evidence that color diversity among normal SNe Ia can have a physical origin. In contrast, SN 2020ue has photometric properties, such as color evolution and light-curve decay rate, similar to those of transitional SNe, spectroscopically it is more aligned with normal SNe Ia. This is evident from spectroscopic indicators such as the pseudo-equivalent width of \\ion{Si}{II} lines. Thus, such SNe Ia that are photometrically at the edge of the standard normal SNe Ia range may be missed in cosmological SNe Ia samples. Our results highlight that spectroscopic analysis of SNe Ia around peak brightness is crucial for identifying intrinsic color variations and constructing a more complete and physically homogeneous SN Ia sample for precision cosmology."}

We used nearly simultaneous data obtained from 2017 June 6 to 2022 August 6 (MJD 57910 -- 59797) in optical, UV, X-ray and $γ$-ray wavebands from various instruments including Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, NuSTAR, AstroSat (SXT and LAXPC), Fermi-LAT, and TeV flux from MAGIC. During 2017 July, 1ES 2344+514 appeared to be in the highest flaring state compared to other periods. We used the 0.5 -- 7.0 keV and 3.0 -- 20.0 keV data, respectively, from SXT and LAXPC of AstroSat and also 0.3 -- 8.0 keV and 3.0 -- 79.0 keV data, respectively, from Swift-XRT and NuSTAR. A joint fit between SXT and LAXPC, and between Swift-XRT and NuSTAR has been done for constraining the synchrotron peak. A clear shift in the synchrotron peak has been observed, which included 1ES 2344+514 in the HSP BL Lac family. A `harder-when-brighter' trend is observed in X-rays, and the opposite trend, i.e., `softer-when-brighter', is seen in the $γ$-rays. The multi-epoch broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of this source were built and studied to get an idea of the radiation processes. The SEDs were fitted using a steady-state leptonic one-zone synchrotron+SSC model, and the fitted parameters of the emission region are consistent with those of other TeV BL Lacs. In this study, we found a weak correlation tendency between bolometric luminosity and magnetic field (B), as well as between bolometric luminosity and the break Lorentz factor ($γ_{break}$)."}

We find that the E-P method cannot reproduce the inverse-square law, except over a narrow range of flux thresholds and even here we don't get pristine agreement. The main reason for the deviation is that the synthetic radio pulsar catalog is truncated based on a cut on the pulsar signal to noise ratio (SNR), which has a non-linear dependence on the flux along with plenty of scatter. We show that the disagreement is exacerbated as we raise the SNR threshold. We then demonstrate that if we create a synthetic catalog based on a flux cut (instead of an SNR-based threshold), we can recover the true distance exponent, with an accuracy ranging from pristine agreement to within $\\pm 1 σ$ depending on the chosen flux threshold."}

The origin of the flares is still unknown. We revisited the role of small planetary bodies, originally from the stellar disk, and their tidally disrupted fragments as a source of flaring activity in Sgr A*. We refined previous models by incorporating material strength constraints on the tidal disruption limit and by evaluating the evaporation dynamics of the resulting fragments. We analyzed the tidal fragmentation and gas-induced fragmentation of small planetary bodies with rubble-pile and monolithic structures. Using constraints from recent space missions (e.g., NASA OSIRIS-REx and JAXA Hayabusa2), we estimated the survivability of fragments under aerodynamic heating and computed their expected luminosity from ablation, modeled as fireball flares analogous to meteor events.\n  We find that planetary fragments can approach as close as 8 gravitational radii, consistent with observed flare locations. The fireball model yields luminosities from 1e34 to 1e36 erg/s for fragments whose parent bodies are a few kilometers in size. The derived flare frequency vs. luminosity distribution follows a power law with index 1.83, in agreement with observed values (1.65 - 1.9), while the flare duration scales as L^(-1/3), consistent with observations. We consider the young stars around Sgr A* as the planetary reservoir. Given a small-body population analogous in mass to the primordial Kuiper belt and the common existence of close-in super-Earths and long-period Neptunes, we show that this planetary reservoir can supply the observed flares."}

Additionally, we observed that increasing the DM parameter substantially enlarges the photon sphere, the critical impact parameter, and thus the shadow radius, whereas the magnetic charge $g$ produces only negligible corrections. The DM component also modifies the optical appearance of the accretion disk: higher $b$ systematically suppresses the observed radiation intensity and reduces image brightness, while changes in $g$ yield only marginal effects. Subsequently, using the Novikov-Thorne thin disk model, we analyze primary and secondary images, observed flux, and redshift patterns, showing that PFDM noticeably alters image size and brightness whereas magnetic charge has a negligible influence. No blueshifted regions appear in any configuration. These results highlight several promising observational signatures for testing DM environments and nonlinear electrodynamic effects around BHs."}

The analysis covers the transition from a semi-degenerate to a highly degenerate electron gas and assumes temperatures above the melting threshold of the nuclear lattice, such that nuclei form a liquid. The transport coefficients are obtained by solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation in the relaxation-time approximation, fully incorporating the anisotropies generated by non-quantizing magnetic fields. Electron scattering rates include (i) dynamical screening of the electron-ion interaction in the hard-thermal-loop approximation of QED, (ii) ion-ion correlations within a one-component plasma, and (iii) finite nuclear-size effects. As an additional refinement, we evaluate electron-neutron scattering induced by the coupling of electrons to the anomalous magnetic moment of free neutrons; this contribution is found to be subdominant throughout the parameter range explored. To assess the sensitivity of transport coefficients to the underlying microphysics, we perform calculations for several inner-crust compositions obtained from different nuclear interactions and many-body methods. Across most of the crust, variations in relaxation times and in the components of the anisotropic thermal-conductivity and thermopower tensors reach up to factors 3-4 and 1.5-2, respectively, with the exception of the region where pasta phases are expected. These results provide updated, composition-dependent microphysical inputs for dissipative magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of warm neutron stars and post-merger remnants, where anisotropic heat and charge transport are of critical importance."}

However, most of the known pulsar-binary systems expected to provide this opportunity will exhibit linear variations in the orbital elements due to LT precession that are difficult to separate from variations induced by other mechanisms. In this work, we demonstrate that the pulsar-timing signature of LT precession for an arbitrary orbital orientation produces nonlinear orbital variations; if detected, these nonlinear variations provide a means to constrain $I_{\\rm p}$ without the need for timing-independent measurements of orbital geometry or distance. We show through simulations that these signatures are indeed detectable in pulsar-binary systems with an appropriate combination of timing precision and orbital geometry. Our simulations also show that nonlinear orbital variations from LT precession are expected to be detectable in PSR J1757$-$1854 after only 15 yr of dedicated timing."}

The relevant scattering matrix elements are calculated from one-plasmon exchange diagrams, with in-medium polarization tensors derived within hard-thermal-loop effective theory. Numerical results are obtained for matter composed of carbon nuclei. We find that the conductivity rises with temperature, following a power law sigma proportional to the 4th power of T in the semi-degenerate regime and sigma proportional to T in the nondegenerate regime, due to the intense creation of thermal electron-positron pairs and the resulting collisions among them.

To help settle this debate, we present a systematic, spatially resolved, spectroscopic analysis of both remnants using XMM-Newton. By applying multi-component thermal models, we derive key physical properties including elemental abundances, ejecta temperatures, ambient densities, and explosion energetics. We compare the inferred metal abundance ratios to a wide range of core-collapse and thermonuclear nucleosynthesis models, including new models whose explosion energies differ from the canonical value of $10^{51}$ ergs. We find that the observed Fe/Si and Ca/Si ratios in both SNRs are best matched by certain thermonuclear models. However, no model fully reproduces the complete set of observed abundance patterns. In 3C 397, high Fe enrichment and spatial abundance variations suggest interaction with a dense progenitor environment, and W49B's composition is overall consistent with a thermonuclear origin; however both require a low energy ($\\sim 10^{50}$ erg) supernova explosion. We additionally map the Fe K$α$ line centroid energies and find a spread, with W49B falling within the core-collapse region -- highlighting both environmental complexity and the limitations of this diagnostic for supernova classification.

This allows us to quantify the gamma-ray emission of the entire solar disk for different phases of the solar activity cycle and we present, for the first time, maps of the production locations of gamma rays on the solar surface. We consider both mono-energetic and realistic power-law injection spectra in a simplified dipole-quadrupole current sheet model and potential-field source surface (PFSS) extrapolations for Carrington rotations during solar maximum and minimum. Our results show that magnetic mirroring and large-scale field topology strongly affect the spectral shape and spatial distribution of the emission, with slightly enhanced fluxes predicted at solar minimum. While our simulated baseline fluxes remain below observations, additional effects, such as heavier nuclei, Parker-field mirroring, and deeper atmospheric interactions, could result in further enhancements of fluxes closer to observational values. Hadronic interactions do not only produce gamma rays but also neutrinos. We estimate the expected neutrino flux from the Sun based on our gamma-ray predictions. We find that the expected flux is slightly below current upper limits from IceCube."}

These functionals are often constructed by introducing density dependence into the nucleon-meson couplings, typically through functions that depend only on the vector, i.e., proper baryon density. In this work, we employ a Bayesian framework to investigate how different parametrizations, characterized by distinct functional forms and by their dependencies on vector and scalar densities, affect the properties of dense matter and compact stars. Our analysis demonstrates that although all considered parametrizations yield broadly comparable inferences, the differences in the equation of state and the symmetry energy remain significant at suprasaturation densities, reflecting the sensitivity to the chosen functional form of the density dependence. We find that allowing the nuclear saturation properties in the isoscalar channel, including the skewness coefficient $Q_{sat}$, to be freely adjusted provides adequate flexibility for the current modeling of nuclear and neutron star matter. In contrast, the isovector channel requires further refinement, with freedom extended at least up to the curvature coefficient $K_{sym}$ to capture variations in the symmetry energy and particle composition at high densities. This work advances prior studies by implementing a rational-function parametrization of the density dependence, informed and constrained by multimessenger astrophysical observations."}

Accepted for publication in Astrophysics and Space Science", "summary": "The well-observed type IIP SN 2024bch with the short plateau is shown to be an outcome of the red supergiant explosion with the presupernova mass of 14-15 Msun, the explosion energy of 2x10^{51} erg, and presupernova radius of 1250 Rsun. The early gamma-ray escape demonstrated by the radioactive tail is due to the large Ni-56 extension up to 7400 km/s. The early-time spectral evolution indicates the presence of the circumstellar dense confined envelope with the mass of 0.003-0.006 Msun within 6x10^{14} cm. The deceleration of the outermost ejecta implies the wind with the mass-loss rate of about 6x10^{-4} Msun/yr. The inferred mass-loss rate is by one-two order larger compared to most of type IIP supernovae, but comparable to the wind of type IIL SN 1998S. The asymmetry of the broad H-alpha component on day 144 powered by the circumstellar interaction is the outcome of the Thomson scattering and absorption in the Paschen continuum in the unshocked ejecta."}

To characterize the feedback from the small scales, existing methods employ a static subgrid scheme or one based on theoretical guesses, which usually struggle to capture the time variability and derive physically faithful results. Neural operators are a class of machine learning models that achieve significant speed-up in simulating complex dynamics. We introduce a neural-operator-based ''subgrid black hole'' that learns the small-scale local dynamics and embeds it within the direct multi-level simulations. Trained on small-domain (general relativistic) magnetohydrodynamic data, the model predicts the unresolved dynamics needed to supply boundary conditions and fluxes at coarser levels across timesteps, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts without hand-crafted closures. Thanks to the great speedup in fine-scale evolution, our approach for the first time captures intrinsic variability in accretion-driven feedback, allowing dynamic coupling between the central black hole and galaxy-scale gas. This work reframes subgrid modeling in computational astrophysics with scale separation and provides a scalable path toward data-driven closures for a broad class of systems with central accretors."}

Leveraging this equivalence, we introduce a powerful and computationally efficient framework as an upgraded version of the critical curve method, to systematically map the stability boundaries for multi-fluid mixed stars across the entire parameter space of central pressures. Our analysis, applied to a variety of nuclear and dark matter equations of state, reveals the existence of stable region in the observable mass-radius diagram. By resolving degeneracies with 3-dimensional Mass-Radius-Pressure diagrams, we provide a complete topological view of the ensemble. This work supplies a robust theoretical foundation for interpreting multi-messenger astronomical observations and constraining the properties of dark matter."}

Stable configurations form a surface in the three-dimensional parameter space of (either) central pressure, mass, and radius, which yields a group containing stable mixed stars. This group includes twin stars with identical masses and radii but different interior structures. These results can help interpret compact star observations and constrain dark matter properties through astrophysics."}

We argue that the mm emission comes from a spatially extended region that is magnetically connected to the compact X-ray corona, in analogy to the solar wind and corona. We present an analytic model scaled to corona values in which non-equipartition electrons from multiple heights along an extended conical outflow shape the mm emission. In this model, the 100 GHz emission originates from within $\\lesssim10^4$ gravitational radii ($r_g$) of the central black hole, though the projected distance from the black hole can be as low as $50r_g$ depending on the line-of-sight. Our model predicts a flat emission spectrum $F_ν\\sim{\\rm const}$ and a mm-to-X-ray luminosity ratio $L_{\\rm mm}/L_X\\sim10^{-4}$, consistent with observations. These quantities depend weakly on the underlying electron power-law distribution function and black hole mass. We demonstrate this model's plausibility using a general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of a thin accretion disc as a case study. Our model highlights the need to study continual dissipation along the outflow to connect the X-ray- and mm-emitting regions."}

Its remarkably bright emission, partially due to its close distance to Earth ($z\\sim0.15$), makes this GRB a unique event. The outstanding characteristics of GRB 221009A, including the TeV detection by the LHAASO experiment, triggered deep follow-up observations of the source across all wavebands, including very-high-energy gamma rays with the first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. LST-1 observations started about one day after the onset of the prompt emission, under strong moonlight conditions. This resulted in a hint of a signal with a statistical significance of about 4$σ$. The monitoring of this source continued until the end of November 2022. This constitutes the deepest observation campaign performed on a GRB with LST-1. Here we show the results of this follow-up campaign."}
