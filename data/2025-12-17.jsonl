Using Zwicky Transient Facility light curves, we measure fractional variability ($F_{\\rm var}$) and rest-frame structure functions (SFs) to test whether short-term jet-linked variability is reflected in long-term behaviour. $γ$-ray detected RL-NLSy1s and HPQs show steeply rising SFs, revealing strong long-term coherence despite modest $F_{\\rm var}$, consistent with Doppler-boosted synchrotron emission from relativistic jets. Non-jetted RL-NLSy1s exhibit the highest $F_{\\rm var}$ but plateauing SFs, indicative of stochastic, disc-driven fluctuations lacking long-term coherence. $γ$-ray undetected RL-NLSy1s show the lowest $F_{\\rm var}$ and nearly flat SFs, consistent with weak or absent jet activity across all timescales. Colour-magnitude trends show that jet-dominated sources exhibit redder-when-brighter behaviour, whereas disc-dominated systems exhibit bluer-when-brighter trends.

Radio wave propagation through inhomogeneous distributions of plasma can act as a lens, generating multiple images of the emitted electric field. A lens can produce images of a point source where the phase of the electric field between images remains coherent when observed by a radio telescope. FRB 20220413B shows a complicated pulse structure with time separated components that may be image copies of the main components due to plasma lensing. We perform several analyses to determine if FRB 20220413B is consistent with expectations of a plasma lensed FRB. We analyze and fit the morphology of the burst to a plasma lens model and find consistency in the spectro-temporal profile but not the observed flux. Using the complex-valued channelized voltage data from the CHIME telescope, we perform a time-lag correlation analysis and report correlation signatures present in the electric field of FRB 20220413B. We find that there exists an excess correlation signature only in absolute power and not in phase. We perform a frequency-lag correlation analysis on the spectra of all subcomponents of the burst and find a consistent scintillation bandwidth across all components. We find the scintillation bandwidth is consistent with expectations of scattering due to the Milky Way. We interpret this as all burst components propagating through the same scintillation screen located in the Milky Way, which would generate the excess variance signature observed, even in the absence of phase coherence between burst components. We find that while the burst morphology can be modeled by a plasma lens, the coherent signature present in the time-lag correlation is consistent with the expectations of a common scattering screen, but not coherent plasma lensing."}

In many ways, PTAs manifest the promise of a multimessenger approach to astronomy: they can constrain SMBHB population characteristics that are otherwise difficult to constrain using electromagnetic observations, such as hardening mechanisms at sub-parsec separations. In this work, we quantify this multimessenger promise using Bayesian inference of many realizations of simulated PTA data, while adopting a model for the SMBHBs that has been successfully applied to the 15-year data set of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). Our analyses of 200 realistic, simulated NANOGrav data sets show that there is a greater than 50\\% chance of reducing the prior uncertainty in the SMBHB hardening rate by more than 50\\%, and in the SMBHB evolutionary lifetime by 25--75\\%.

For $M_{\\text{BH}}$--$M_{\\text{Bulge}}$ parameters (in a model without redshift evolution) and the overall normalization parameter of the GSMF, PTA data can provide only marginal information gain beyond the constraints from electromagnetic observations.

We use different mass distributions for three populations depending on the companion stars: double neutron stars, NS - white dwarfs, and low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). To observe the effects of different parametrizations, we use two equation of state (EoS) models: a piecewise polytrope and a fixed sound-speed model at high densities in combination with a low-density EoS. Our results show that the mass distributions of these NS populations are distinct and sensitive to the EoS prior choices. In addition, using a uniform prior on the observable NS maximum mass rather than a nuisance parameter from the unknown high-density EoS, shifts the posterior maximum mass to larger values.

In the literature, the PBH merger rate is calculated analytically, assuming that PBH binaries stay in isolation (i.e. are unperturbed) and evolve solely via GW emission during their entire lifetime. However, if some or all of dark matter consists of PBHs, then as cosmic structures grow, PBH binaries and single PBHs fall inside dark matter halos. In those halos, the PBH binaries' interactions with their environment significantly affect the subsequent evolution of their orbital properties. In this paper, we present a numerical framework that accurately calculates the total PBH merger rate by combining the evolution of isolated binaries outside halos with the dynamics of binaries inside halos. In our work we have found that the isolated binary channel is suppressed at low redshifts and dynamical interactions in halos reshape the merger rate evolution with time, accelerating some mergers. At redshifts of $\\lesssim 2$ the total merger rate is a factor of $\\simeq 50 \\%$ higher than the results assuming that all PBH binaries effectively stay unperturbed until their merger.

The analysis reveals significant deviations in stars with higher surface-to-center total energy-density ratios, $\\frac{ε_s}{ε_c+c^2P_c}$, challenging the established universal relations.\n  For Newtonian stars, hydrostatic equilibrium ensures that the difference between the gravitational potential at the center, $Φ_c$, and at the poles, $Φ_p$, remains constant within sequences of rotating neutron stars characterized by the same central and polar specific enthalpy ($Φ_c - Φ_p = -h_c +h_p$). Combined with the scaling $Φ\\propto R_e^2$, where $R_e$ denotes the equatorial radius, this condition naturally leads to a quasi-universal behavior in the rotational change of radius within these sequences. Similarly, in general relativistic stars, the hydrostatic equilibrium maintains that $Φ^{GR}_{p} - Φ^{GR}_{c}$ remains unchanged within these sequences, where $Φ^{GR}$ is one of the metric potentials.\n  Inspired by this theoretical framework, a toy model has been developed to capture the dependence of gravitational mass and radius deviations on the surface-to-central total energy density ratio. Subsequently, an improved set of empirical universal relations has been proposed, for accurately modeling rapidly rotating compact stars with self-bound EOSs."}

Current research on this uncertainty primarily focuses on hadronic interaction models, the dominant source of muon production. This study presents an approach that takes into account another significant mechanism for muon generation: photonuclear reactions. A robust heuristic technique has been developed to estimate the contribution of these interactions to the total number of muons over a wide range of extensive air shower parameters (including primary particle type, energy, and slant atmospheric depth) and photonuclear interaction models, with an absolute percentage error on the order of $10\\%$ in the estimated number of muons.

Accretion solutions that involve the formation of shocks are particularly intriguing, as they are expected to naturally produce observable variability features. However, despite their theoretical significance, time-dependent studies exploring the stability and evolution of such shocked solutions remain relatively scarce. To address this gap, we perform simulations of transonic accretion flows around a black hole in ideal magneto-hydrodynamic framework. Our simulations are initialized using boundary conditions derived from semi-analytical hydrodynamical models, allowing us to explore the stability of these flows under varying magnetic field strengths. The presence of magnetic fields modifies the dynamics of the accretion flow through magnetic pressure, and the resulting force imbalance induces oscillations in the position of shock front. Our results show that variations in the emitted luminosity arising from shock oscillations appear as quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), a characteristic feature commonly observed in accreting black holes. We find that the QPO frequency is determined by the radial position of the shock front: oscillations occurring closer to the black hole produce frequencies of tens of hertz, whereas shocks located farther out yield sub-hertz frequencies"}

The results indicate that the magnetic field significantly influences the position of the innermost stable circular orbit of charged particle and frequency distribution of epicyclic motion, which excites more resonance model variants, enhancing observational effects. Additionally, we employ the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to evaluate resonance model and its various variants. The support for different models from observational data shows significant variation: $E R_8$ as the best model is supported strongly, $ER_3$ model has moderate evidence of support, $ER_6$ and $ER_7$ models are considerably less support, while other resonance models have essentially no support. For models more supported by the observational data, the allowed ranges of the regularization parameter: $0\\leq a<0.736$ ($68\\%$ confidence level) suggests that HFQPOs data support the magnetized black bounce spacetime as a regular black hole, and the smaller value of the regularization parameter indicates a possibility of the presence of quantum effects.

Submitted to ApJ", "summary": "Shear flows, ubiquitous in space and astrophysical plasmas, can accelerate particles through turbulence excited by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We present the first numerical study of particle acceleration in non-relativistic, magnetized, and purely shear-driven turbulence that includes full particle backreaction. Using two-dimensional MHD-PIC simulations with an initially uniform flow-aligned magnetic field and external stirring force, we demonstrate that sustained particle acceleration requires continuously driven turbulence, whereas freely decaying turbulence rapidly depletes its energy reservoirs and halts the acceleration. The acceleration mechanism operates through the systematic distortion of gyro-orbits by turbulent electric fields: acceleration phases extend the particle trajectory along the electric force, increasing the energy gain, while deceleration phases shorten the trajectory, reducing the energy loss. This asymmetry produces net energy gain despite stochastic fluctuations, with the mean energy change scaling quadratically with shear velocity, characteristic of second-order Fermi acceleration. Initially monoenergetic particles develop substantial non-thermal tails after the turbulence onset. For particles repeatedly crossing shear layers, their energization follows geometric Brownian motion with weak systematic drift, yielding a log-normal distribution. High-energy particles exhibit pitch-angle anisotropy, becoming preferentially perpendicular to the flow-aligned magnetic field as their gyroradii exceed the turbulent layer width. These results establish shear-driven turbulence as a viable particle acceleration mechanism, providing a general model for particle energization in shear flows."}

A key feature of DAO is the incorporation of a high-temperature corrected cross section and an exact redistribution function to accurately treat Compton scattering.

To further explore this conclusion, we perform a suite of idealized, controlled simulations targeting the relative roles of merger-induced sloshing and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. Our models systematically isolate and combine these mechanisms to predict observable velocity profiles and X-ray line shapes, providing direct comparison to XRISM and Hitomi data. We find that neither sloshing nor AGN activity alone can reproduce the observed velocity dispersion profile; only their combined action matches the elevated dispersions both at the cluster core and outskirts. Power-spectrum analysis reveals distinct spatial signatures: sloshing generates large-scale coherent motions, while AGN feedback injects turbulence and broadens the velocity spectrum at small scales, especially in the core. By forward-modeling spectral line profiles, we show how these dynamics imprint unique observational signatures on X-ray emission. Our results underscore the necessity of accounting for both large-scale and small-scale drivers of gas motions in the ICM when interpreting high-resolution spectroscopic data, and provide guidance for the analysis of forthcoming XRISM observations."}

In this work, we model the disk formation following the debris stream self-intersection in a TDE. We track the multi-band emission using three-dimensional, frequency-integrated and multi-group radiation hydrodynamic simulations. We find a more circularized disk forms about 24 days following the initial stream-stream collision, after the mass fallback rate peaks and once the debris stream density decreases. Despite the absence of a circularized disk at early times, various shocks and the asymmetric photosphere are sufficient to drive a wide range of optical-to-X-ray ratios and soft-X-ray variability. We find that with strong apsidal precession, the first light is from the stream-stream collision. It launches an optically-thick outflow, but only produces modest prompt emission. The subsequent optical and ultraviolet (UV) light curve rise is mainly powered by shocks in the turbulent accretion flow close to the black hole. The optical-UV luminosity peaks roughly when the disk forms and shock-driven outflows subside. The disk is optically and geometrically thick, extending well beyond the circularization radius. Radiation pressure clears the polar region and leaves optically-thin channels. We obtain the broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) directly from multi-group simulations with 16-20 frequency groups. The SED has a black body component that peaks in the extreme UV. The soft X-ray component either resembles a thermal tail, or can be described by a shallower power law associated with bulk Compton scattering. The blackbody parameters are broadly consistent with observed optical TDEs and vary weakly with viewing angle. In contrast, soft X-ray emission is highly angle-dependent."}

Most FRB sources are detected only once, while some are repeaters. Variation patterns observed in the rotation measure (RM) of some repeaters -- indicate that the local magneto-ionic environments of these FRB sources are highly dynamic. It has been suggested that a Be star-magnetar binary system is a possible origin for such variation. FRB 20201124A is notable among these sources since it is the most active one and exhibits substantial temporal variations of RM measured by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The physics behind this long-term behavior is poorly understood. Here we propose that, within the framework of the Be star-magnetar binary scenario, the observed variation of RM is attributed to a combination of orbital motion and the precession of the circumstellar disk of the Be star. While a ~785-day precession of the disk contributes to the observed decrease in the amplitude of the variation, our model predicts that the amplitude oscillates with this period."}

We characterise the 2025 outburst using X-ray timing and spectroscopy from XMM-Newton and Swift (and a late-time NuSTAR observation), together with contemporaneous optical photometry from LCO, and compare the spin frequency with the 2022 outburst. Timing searches detect coherent pulsations at ~313.6 Hz with no measurable frequency derivative during the XMM-Newton exposure. Relative to its 2022 outburst, we measure a long-term spin-down of ~-2x10^-14 Hz s^-1, consistent with magnetic-dipole braking in quiescence. The pulse profile is nearly sinusoidal, with significant power at the fundamental, second, and fifth harmonics; the fractional amplitude decreases with increasing flux and shows soft lags up to a few keV. The 0.5-10 keV spectrum is well described by absorbed thermal Comptonisation (photon index ~2.4) plus a cool blackbody (kT ~0.23 keV) consistent with emission from a surface hotspot; no reflection or Fe-line features are detected. Requiring R_m \\leq R_co implies B_s ~(0.5-3)x10^8 G for d=(5 \\pm 2) kpc and ξ=0.3-0.5, below the upper limit from the secular spin-down (B_p \\leq 10^9 G), possibly indicating a mildly leaky propeller. The optical emission lies on the neutron-star branch of the L_OIR-L_X relation, consistent with reprocessing in a compact disc. The optical SEDs are broadly flat, while an early red excess suggests a transient jet contribution during the initial hard X-ray phase; an optical peak delayed relative to the X-rays may trace an outward-propagating heating front and rapid disc evolution in these short-lived outbursts."}

However, the rapid fading of their afterglows and the scarcity of spectroscopic measurements make photometric classification crucial for timely high-redshift identification. We present an ensemble machine learning framework for redshift classification of GRBs based solely on their optical plateau and prompt emission properties. Our dataset comprises 171 long GRBs observed by the Swift UVOT and more than 450 ground-based telescopes. The analysis pipeline integrates robust statistical techniques, including M-estimator outlier rejection, multivariate imputation using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator feature selection, followed by a SuperLearner ensemble combining parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric algorithms. The optimal model, trained on raw optical data with outlier removal at a redshift threshold of z equals 2.0, achieves a true positive rate of 74 percent and an area under the curve of 0.84, maintaining balanced generalization between training and test sets. At higher thresholds, such as z equals 3.0, the classifier sustains strong discriminative power with an area under the curve of 0.88. Validation on an independent GRB sample yields 97 percent overall accuracy, perfect specificity, and an ensemble area under the curve of 0.93. Compared to previous prompt- and X-ray-based classifiers, our optical framework offers enhanced sensitivity to high-redshift events, improved robustness against data incompleteness, and greater applicability to ground-based follow-up. We also publicly release a web application that enables real-time redshift classification, facilitating rapid identification of candidate high-redshift GRBs for cosmological studies."}

Specifically, the two QPO types were detected simultaneously but exhibited distinct energy dependencies: the type-C QPO was dominant in the hard X-ray band (10-30 keV), while the type-B QPO was more prominent in the soft X-ray band (1-10 keV). Further analysis reveals that the emergence of the type-C QPO suppresses the strength of the type-B QPO, particularly above 10 keV. Tracking the detailed evolution of these QPOs, we find that the weakening of the type-B QPO coincides with the strengthening of the type-C QPO, indicating a competitive interaction between them. These findings reveal a more complex relationship between type-B and type-C QPOs than previously recognized, suggesting they originate from distinct but interacting physical components within the accretion flow and/or jet, and providing new insights into the dynamics of accretion state transitions."}

We describe the field evolution both for one barotropic fluid as well as two collisionally coupled barotropic fluids with different density profiles using the anelastic approximation and the Navier-Stokes equations to simulate the evolution in three dimensions. In the one-fluid case, a single fluid describes the motion of the charged particles. In the two-fluid model, the neutral fluid is coupled to the electrically conductive fluid by collisions, the latter being dragged by the magnetic field. In this model, both fluids have distinct density profiles. This forces them to move at slightly different velocities, resulting in a relative motion between the two barotropic fluids -- ambipolar diffusion. We develop a code based on Dedalus and study the evolution of simple poloidal dipolar and toroidal magnetic fields. Previous 2D studies found that poloidal magnetic fields evolve towards a stable Grad-Shafranov equilibrium. In our 3D simulations we find an instability of the two-fluid system similar to the one in the barotropic fluid system. After the instability saturates, a highly non-linear Lorentz force introduces small-scale fluid motion that leads to turbulence, development of a cascade and significant, non-axially symmetric changes in the magnetic field configuration. Fluid viscosity plays an essential role in regularizing the small-scale fluid motion, providing an energy drain."}

On occasions, the augmented spin-down decays gradually in an exponential manner, particularly after the largest glitch events. The young pulsar PSR J0537-6910 exhibits the highest known glitching rate, with 60 events detected in nearly 18 years of monitoring. Despite most PSR J0537-6910 glitches being large, only one exponential recovery has been reported, following its first discovered glitch. This is puzzling, as pulsars of similar characteristics typically present significant exponential recoveries. We aim to determine whether this reflects an intrinsic difference in PSR J0537-6910 or a detectability issue, for example due to its high glitch frequency. The full dataset, including recent NICER observations, was systematically searched for exponential relaxations. Each glitch was tested for evidence of a recovery over a broad range of trial timescales. Promising candidates were investigated further by comparing recovery models with and without an exponential term using Bayesian evidence. We discovered six new glitches, bringing the total to 66. Our criteria strongly indicates the presence of 11 previously undetected exponential recoveries. We presente updated glitch and timing solutions. Exponential recoveries are detected only for the largest glitches, though not all of them. The inferred timescales range from 4 to 37 d, with the decaying frequency increment generally below $1\\%$ of the total. We find that $\\ddotν$ can remain stable across several glitches, with persistent changes associated with only some events. In particular, it tends to be lowest after glitches with exponential recoveries, yielding inter-glitch braking indices between 6 and 9. Following glitches without recoveries, $\\ddotν$ is higher, leading to braking indices between 10 and 35."}

These pulsars were initially discovered through their single-pulse emission and therefore designated as rotating radio transients (RRATs). Follow-up timing campaigns yielded a number of higher signal-to-noise summed pulse profiles for each pulsar, allowing us to obtain timing solutions both through single pulses as well as the standard method of time-integrating the pulsar's emission. We find that the two methods return timing parameters which are usually in agreement within two standard deviations, and have similar sized error bars. The single-pulse timing solutions have significantly higher RMS errors and reduced chi-squared values, likely due to pulse jitter. The distribution of wait times between detected single pulses indicates a significant amount of pulse clustering in time on short timescales from all three sources. For all sources, the presence of low-level emission outside of the sparse bright pulses and lack of giant pulses is more reminiscent of highly nulling canonical radio pulsars than extremely transient RRATs, highlighting the diversity of emission behavior observed from sources published as RRATs."}

We present a comprehensive analysis of the X-ray timing and spectral variability of 16 Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies detected by Fermi-LAT, based on 29 epochs of XMM-Newton observations. A moderate intraday flux variability is observed throughout the sample, with fractional variability ranging from 5 to 16\\%. The temporal study of 1H\\,0323+342 reveals a distinctive turnover timescale in structure functions, along with notable variations in flux and power spectral density slopes. The hardness ratio in some epochs demonstrates a clear trend of softer-when-brighter. The X-ray spectra of 1H 0323+342, PMN J0948+0022, RGB J1644+263, PKS 1502+036, and J1246+0238 are well fitted by a power-law + blackbody model, suggesting a bright disk along with a jet, and J1222+0413 is fitted by broken power-law, while the remaining sources are well fitted by a power-law model revealing the non-thermal domination. The X-ray luminosity exhibits a strong correlation with $γ$-ray and disk luminosity, and a strong correlation with the jet power, suggesting a close coupling of disk and jet. Additionally, we have found an anti-correlation between the X-ray spectral index and the X-ray luminosity, as well as with the FWHM of H$β$ line, indicating a complex interaction between the central engine, jet activity, and the accretion disk in these sources."}

In this paper, we develop self-consistent leptonic, hadronic, and leptohadronic models that reproduce both the observed spectrum and morphology of the source. Purely leptonic models are energetically more favorable yet they require rather specific morphological assumptions. The gamma-ray morphology of the source can be better explained within a hadronic scenario based on the identification of cold gas structures spatially correlated with the observed gamma-ray emission. However, a purely hadronic model for the source emission requires a substantial energy reservoir in protons and fails to reproduce the extended X-ray emission recently detected by XRISM. We show that emission including a combination of leptonic and hadronic components can reproduce both the spectral and morphological properties of the source. We provide predictions for the X-ray and neutrino spectra of~the~nebula that can discriminate the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the overall source signal."}

Minor typos of the original English version of the paper are corrected", "summary": "Using the data from the all-sky survey in soft X-rays performed by the eROSITA telescope onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma observatory we identified known radio and $γ$-ray pulsars in the eastern half of the sky. As a result, new candidate counterparts were found for twelve pulsars of different ages and types at a $\\gtrsim$ 3$σ$ confidence level. A comparable number had been previously identified in the western half of the sky. In total, this represents about 12\\% of all known pulsars already detected in X-rays. For the new counterparts, we provide estimates of their X-ray fluxes, preliminary characteristics of their X-ray spectra, and brief descriptions of the pulsars' properties. In addition, in the eastern half of the sky eROSITA detected 55 pulsars previously identified in X-rays by other telescopes."}
