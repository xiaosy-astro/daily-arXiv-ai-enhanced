The source is detected by NuSTAR up to 30 keV with evidence for the synchrotron burnoff effect in the changing spatial morphology with increasing energy. The broadband 2-30 keV spectrum of PWN G0.9+0.1 is modeled by a single power law with photon index $Γ=2.11\\pm0.07$. We combined the new X-ray data with the multiwavelength observations in radio, GeV, and TeV gamma rays and modeled the SED, applying a one-zone and a multi-zone leptonic model. The comparison of the models is successful, as we obtained physically compatible results in the two cases. Through the one-zone model, we constrain the age of the system to $\\sim2.2$ kyr, as well as reproduce the observed PWN and SNR radio sizes. In both the one-zone and multi-zone leptonic models, the electron injection spectrum is well-described by a single power law with spectral index $p \\sim 2.6$ and a maximum electron energy of $\\sim2$ PeV, suggesting the source could be a leptonic PeVatron candidate. We estimate the average magnetic field to be $B_{\\rm PWN} \\sim 20\\ μ$G. We also report the serendipitous NuSTAR detection of renewed X-ray activity from the very faint X-ray transient XMMU J174716.1-281048 and characterize its spectrum."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "The Milky Way's Galactic Center hosts the black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), which provides us with a close-up view into supermassive black hole accretion and feedback. Recent works have shown that the winds from $\\sim 30$ Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars orbiting Sgr A* at about 4 arcsec are important contributors to feeding the supermassive black hole. A nuclear star cluster (NSC) with a mass of several $10^6 \\, \\text{M}_\\odot$, of which $10^6 \\, \\text{M}_\\odot$ is within 1 pc, also surrounds Sgr A*. The NSC contributes to the gravitational potential in the Galactic Center, affecting the orbits of the WR stars and their stellar winds. In this work, we examine the effects that the NSC has on the accretion of these stellar winds onto Sgr A* which have previously been neglected. We find that, on the parsec scale, the effect from the gravitational potential of the NSC is negligible on the wind-fed accretion flow, validating the existing simulations used in the literature."}

However, its significance for astrophysical phenomena, including particle acceleration, has yet to be appreciated. MP-energized particles tap energy from magnetic-field oscillations. A particle's momentum component perpendicular to the local B-field increases during field growth by virtue of the adiabatic invariant $p_{\\perp}^{2}/B=const$. The gained $p_{\\perp}$ is then partially scattered elastically into the parallel momentum, $p_{\\parallel}$, with $p^{2}=p_{\\parallel}^{2}+p_{\\perp}^{2}=const$, thereby retaining some fraction of the gained energy before the field decreases to its minimum. This scattering breaks the reversibility of energy exchange between particles and oscillating magnetic fields, thereby increasing the particle energy after each MP cycle. Field oscillations are often assumed to be sinusoidal, and the resulting MP is treated perturbatively. These simplifications restrict astrophysical applications, leaving objects with strong magnetic perturbations outside the scope of adequate treatment. We develop a nonperturbative approach to MP that is suitable for a broad spectrum of magnetic turbulence. The treatment comprises two steps. The first step is common: converting a kinetic equation into an infinite hierarchy of moments of the particle distribution function. The second step is new in MP treatments: we find an exact closure at an arbitrary level of the moment system. The heating is treated exactly at the second-moment closure. Particle acceleration generally requires a higher-level closure to determine the power-law index and the maximum energy of accelerated particles. We propose a method for extracting these crucial acceleration data from the second moment for a broadband random field."}

Our post-Newtonian approximation analysis yields predicted periastron advance rates from 1.6 to 80.5 deg/yr and orbital period decay rates between -5 and -176 $μ$s/yr for the binary pulsar population. We derive common envelope efficiency parameters ($α_{CE}$) for representative progenitor scenarios within our sample, finding values between 0.63 and 1.16, with notable sensitivity to the binding energy parameter $λ$. Binary neutron star merger rates are estimated at $22.77^{+6.83}_{-6.83}$ Myr$^{-1}$ for the Milky Way, corresponding to a volumetric rate of $227.71^{+68.31}_{-68.31}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with the latest LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observational constraints.

Zahn's tidal equations \\cite{1977A&A....57..383Z, 1989A&A...220..112Z} were employed for numerical integrations to describe tidal effects and their role in orbital and spin evolution. We estimated the timescales for tidal synchronization and orbital circularization for each system. The results indicate that tidal effects play only a minor role in orbital decay compared with energy loss due to gravitational wave emission. This is evident in the compact system PSR 1913+16, where the orbital period decreases by approximately 76.5 $μ$s/yr as a result of gravitational radiation. The double pulsar J0737-3039A/B exhibits faster orbital evolution, with synchronization occurring in about 8.4$\\times10{^3}$ years, whereas the wider system J0621+1002 shows negligible orbital change over timescales exceeding 10$^{10}$ years. The simulations demonstrate clear trends of decreasing semi-major axis and eccentricity, accompanied by an increase in spin rate among the binary pulsars studied. The derived apsidal motion constants [$k\\simeq0.1$] are consistent with theoretical expected values, and the corresponding tidal friction times (between a few hours to several days) agree well with theoretical predication. These results emphasize the dominant role of relativistic effects in neutron star binaries and highlight the importance of including gravitational-wave terms long-term orbital evolution"}

Theodore Zhang"], "title": "Multimessenger Prospects for Low-Luminosity Gamma-Ray Bursts: Joint Neutrino and X-Ray Observations", "comment": null, "summary": "Low--luminosity gamma-ray bursts (LLGRBs) are promising candidates for high-energy neutrinos, yet no coincident neutrino events have been detected so far. Recent advances in X-ray time-domain astronomy, together with the development of next-generation neutrino telescopes, open new opportunities for joint X-ray and neutrino observations of these transients. We calculate the jet dynamical evolution and the associated neutrino production for both non-magnetized and magnetized outflows. For individual events, joint X-ray and neutrino detection is generally limited to nearby LLGRBs or sources with high luminosities. Thus, we consider a next-generation neutrino telescope with an effective area enhanced by a factor of $\\sim30$ relative to IceCube. In the non-magnetized scenario, joint detection of individual events is enabled for sources with typical isotropic luminosities of $L_{\\mathrm{iso}}\\sim10^{47}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$ out to luminosity distances of $D_L\\sim1.6\\times10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$, corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $1$ per year. In contrast, for the magnetized scenario at the same luminosity, the accessible distance is significantly reduced, with joint observations confined to sources within $D_L\\sim6.5\\times10^{1}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ and an expected detection rate of order $0.5$ per year. For stacked samples of $\\sim100$ magnetized LLGRBs, stacking substantially enlarges the accessible distance range, enabling joint observations for sources with representative luminosities of $L_{\\mathrm{iso}}\\sim1\\times10^{47}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$ out to $D_L\\lesssim7.0\\times10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ and corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $2$ per year.

Under review at the Journal of High Energy Astrophysics. Comments welcome", "summary": "Long Period Transients (LPTs) are a recently identified class of sources characterized by periodic radio bursts lasting seconds to minutes, with flux densities that might reach several tens of Jy. These radio bursts repeat with periodicity from minutes to hours, and they exhibit strong polarization and transient activity periods. To date, about 12 such sources have been identified, which might encompass the same or different physical scenarios. Proposed explanations include binary systems with a white dwarf and a low-mass star companion, slow-spinning magnetars, highly magnetized isolated white dwarfs, and other exotic objects. In a few cases the optical counterpart indeed points toward a white dwarf with a low-mass companion, while in other cases, transient X-ray emission was detected, very common in magnetars. However, despite being able to reproduce partially some of the characteristics of LPTs, all the proposed scenarios find difficulty in explaining the exact physical origin of their bright, highly polarized and periodic radio emission. We review here the state-of-the-art in the observations and interpretation of this puzzling class of radio transients."}

Starting with a set of five general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with dynamically important magnetic fields, we perform ray-tracing calculations to produce spectra including synchrotron emission, bremsstrahlung emission, and Compton scattering. Our models with similar Eddington ratios to the objects for which the relationship was inferred naturally reproduce observations without tuning. Our lower Eddington ratio models depart from this relationship, likely attributable to an observational bias against extremely low accretion rates. We find that inverse Compton scattering dominates the production of X-rays over bremsstrahlung radiation in almost all models, and in all models consistent with the observed correlation. We find only a modest spin dependence in this relationship. This study demonstrates that a compact, hot accretion flow with dynamically important magnetic fields can naturally explain observed millimeter and X-ray properties in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. Future work should explore the impacts of non-thermal electron populations, weaker magnetic fields, and radiative cooling."}
