These\ninteractions can completely disintegrate a nucleus of iron over trajectory\nlengths of a few and up to hundreds of megaparsecs, depending on the energy of\nthe UHECR. The stochastic nature of these interactions means that it is not\npossible to describe them deterministically for a single cosmic ray, and an\nexact formulation of the probability distributions is not yet available.\nCurrent approaches describe these interactions using either Monte Carlo\nsimulations or solving ordinary differential equations that neglect\nstochasticity.

As a result, we define the\nparameter space allowing for jets to remain choked, and we quantify the\nacceleration rate and efficiency for charged particles in the strong shocks of\nsuch astrophysical environments. Preliminary results show that high Mach\nnumbers ($\\sim 100$) after 5-10 seconds of constant energy injection\ncharacterize the forward shock, possibly allowing for efficient particle\nacceleration and high-energy neutrino production. Our results are presented for\nblue supergiant progenitors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In both general\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations as well as simplified\nmodels of the black hole magnetosphere, the polarization angle, quantified by\nthe complex observable arg(beta_2), depends strongly and systematically on the\nblack hole spin. This relationship arises from the coupling between spin and\nthe structure of the magnetic field in the emission region, and it can be\ncomputed analytically in the force-free limit. To explore this connection\nfurther, we develop a semi-analytic inflow framework that solves the time\nstationary axisymmetric equations of GRMHD in the black hole's equatorial\nplane; this model can interpolate between the force-free and inertial regimes\nby varying the magnetization of the inflow. Our model demonstrates how finite\ninertia modifies the structure of the electromagnetic field and can be used to\nquantitatively predict the observed polarization pattern. By comparing reduced\nmodels, GRMHD simulations, and analytic limits, we show that the observed\nsynchrotron polarization can serve as a robust diagnostic of spin under\nassumptions about Faraday rotation and the emission geometry. Applied to EHT\ndata, the model disfavors high-spin configurations for both M87* and Sgr A*,\nhighlighting the potential of polarimetric imaging as a probe of both black\nhole spin and near-horizon plasma physics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
