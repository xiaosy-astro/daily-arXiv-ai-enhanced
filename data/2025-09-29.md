Abstract: Photonuclear interactions between ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) nuclei
and surrounding photon fields are key to understanding the connection between
the compositions observed at Earth and those emitted from the sources. These
interactions can completely disintegrate a nucleus of iron over trajectory
lengths of a few and up to hundreds of megaparsecs, depending on the energy of
the UHECR. The stochastic nature of these interactions means that it is not
possible to describe them deterministically for a single cosmic ray, and an
exact formulation of the probability distributions is not yet available.
Current approaches describe these interactions using either Monte Carlo
simulations or solving ordinary differential equations that neglect
stochasticity. Because of the limitations of these approaches, only partial
capture of the process is achieved. This paper presents an analytic
probabilistic description of UHECR interactions and the resulting nuclear
cascades, establishing their connection to Markov jump processes. The
fundamental properties of these cascades are presented, as is the computation
of the usual quantities of interest, such as the horizon, spectrum, and
composition. The benefits of this description are outlined using astrophysical
examples related to extragalactic propagation and UHECR sources.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了遮蔽严重的活动星系核（AGN），尤其是康普顿厚源（CT-AGN），通过多种X射线和中红外诊断方法，分析了其遮蔽介质的几何参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解超大质量黑洞（SMBH）的增长和宇宙X射线背景（CXB）的起源需要研究遮蔽严重的AGN，尤其是康普顿厚源。然而，观测到的CT-AGN比例远低于模型预测，这主要是由于强烈的吸收偏差。

Method: 选取了26个邻近（红移z<0.1）AGN样本，来自Swift-BAT 150个月目录，使用NuSTAR和软X射线望远镜（Xmm-Newton, Chandra, 或Swift-xrt）观测。通过MyTorus、Borus02和UXCLUMPY三种自洽的环形模型来限制遮蔽介质的参数，包括线-of-sight柱密度（N_H,los）和其他几何参数。

Result: 三种模型在N_H,los估计上基本一致，但Borus02更倾向于将较多的源归类为CT-AGN。使用中红外/X射线关系和机器学习模型与宽带最佳拟合N_H,los测量值进行基准测试，发现前者的中重遮蔽区域（logN_H ≳ 23.5 cm^{-2}）效果较好，但后者在康普顿薄到中度厚区域（logN_H ≲ 23.5 cm^{-2}）提供了更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 尽管中红外/X射线关系在重遮蔽区域有效，但机器学习模型在康普顿薄到中度厚区域显示了更高的准确性，可能更高效地弥合观测遮蔽与模型预测之间的差距。

Abstract: Heavily obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), especially Compton-thick
sources with line-of-sight column density ($N_{\rm H,los}$) $>$ 10$^{24}$
cm$^{-2}$, are critical to understanding supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth
and the origin of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB). However, their observed
fraction remains significantly below model predictions, due to strong
absorption bias, even in the hard X-ray (i.e., above 10 keV) band. We analyze a
sample of 26 nearby ($z < 0.1$) AGN from the Swift-BAT 150-month catalog,
selected via mid-IR to X-ray diagnostics and observed with NuSTAR and soft
X-ray telescopes (Xmm-Newton, Chandra, or Swift-xrt). Using self-consistent
torus models (MyTorus, Borus02, and UXCLUMPY), we aim to constrain $N_{\rm
H,los}$, the average torus column density, and other geometrical parameters of
the obscuring medium. A comparative analysis among the three torus models
showed that while estimates of $N_{\rm{H,los}}$ were generally in agreement,
Borus02 tended to classify a slightly larger number of sources as Compton-thick
AGN (CT-AGN). Building on this comparison, we benchmark two prediction schemes
-- a mid-IR/X-ray relation and a machine-learning model -- against our
broadband best-fit $N_{\rm H,los}$ measurements to assess which approach more
effectively bridges the gap between predicted and measured obscuration, finding
that while the former works effectively in the heavily obscured region
(log$\rm{N_H} \gtrsim$ 23.5 $\rm{cm^{-2}}$), the latter provides improved
accuracy, particularly for Compton-thin to moderately thick regimes
(log$\rm{N_H} \lesssim$ 23.5 $\rm{cm^{-2}}$).

Abstract: The Seyfert 1 galaxy J1626+5120 is estimated to host a $10^8 M_{\odot}$ black
hole (BH) accreting at Eddington ratio $\dot{m}_{\text{Edd}} \approx 0.043$.
Its long-term multi-band light curve data show flicker-like variations, but in
a well-sampled $g$-band light curve, we are able to determine a $\simeq 329$\,d
quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at a $\sim$4.53$\sigma$ significance. Six
optical spectra were obtained for the source, three of which were taken by us.
The spectra show that the variations were mainly because of flux changes
blueward of 4000\,\AA. We also analyze X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) data obtained
with {\it the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift)}, which targeted the
source in the past two years. X-ray and UV emissions of the source show
variations correlated with optical. Time lags of four UV bands and four optical
bands are determined with respect to the X-ray emission, which are consistent
with a continuum reprocessing disk model. These properties point out a disk
origin for the QPO, likely due to Lense-Thirring (LT) precession of the
accretion flow at $\sim$20 gravitational radii of the BH. This QPO could be a
key case linking sub-year long QPOs in jets, which have more cases reported, to
LT precession.

### [4] [Fermi detection of $γ$-rays from the radio-quiet Seyfert galaxy NGC 3281](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21958)

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We report the detection of significant $\gamma$-ray emission with $\it
Fermi$-LAT from the radio-quiet Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 3281, with a luminosity of
$5.9\,(\pm 1.7)\times10^{41}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$ at a significance of
$6.22\,\sigma$ (TS = $42.81$). The power-law photon index is $2.61~(\pm 0.24)$,
indicative of a soft spectrum. The star formation activity in NGC 3281 is
insufficient to explain its $\gamma$-ray luminosity based on the empirical
relation between the infrared and $\gamma$-ray luminosities observed in other
sources. The multiwavelength spectrum can be explained as due to inverse
Compton scattering by relativistic electrons in the corona or jet of seed
photons from the corona, disk and torus. The source is Compton-thick and
attenuation of GeV photons due to pair production in the corona is
nonnegligible (with an optical depth of about 10). The intrinsic $\gamma$-ray
luminosity is inferred to be $3.4\,\times10^{42}$ and
$2.2\,\times10^{41}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$ for the corona and jet model,
respectively. The observed $\gamma$-ray and radio luminosities is roughly
consistent with the known correlation between the two quantities, among the
lowest luminosity regime. The jet origin is valid only if the radio emission is
dominated by the jet.

### [5] [Revisiting 3C 279 jet morphology with space VLBI at 26 microarcsecond resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21987)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper presents observations of the blazar 3C 279 at 22 GHz using the RadioAstron mission, revealing a predominantly toroidal magnetic field in the jet and detecting ground-space fringes up to 8Gλ with an angular resolution of 26μas. The study also finds a significant drop in the jet's total intensity compared to previous observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the magnetic field structure and fine-scale jet properties of the blazar 3C 279 at 22 GHz using the advanced capabilities of the RadioAstron mission.

Method: The observations were conducted using the space VLBI mission RadioAstron on 2018 January 15. Images were reconstructed using the RML method in the eht-imaging library, and ground-space fringes were detected up to a projected baseline length of approximately 8Gλ.

Result: The electric vector position angles are mostly aligned with the jet direction, indicating a predominantly toroidal magnetic field. The fine-scale structure of the relativistic jet was observed extending up to about 180 parsec from the radio core, but the filamentary structure reported in 2014 observations was not detected. Public 43 GHz data showed a significant drop in the jet's total intensity.

Conclusion: The findings confirm a toroidal magnetic field in the jet and estimate its strength to be around 0.2 G. The lack of filamentary structure in the current study suggests possible changes in the jet's emission properties or observational conditions over time.

Abstract: We present observations of the blazar 3C 279 at 22 GHz using the space VLBI
mission RadioAstron on 2018 January 15. Images in both total intensity and
fractional polarization are reconstructed using RML method implemented in the
eht-imaging library. The electric vector position angles are found to be mostly
aligned with the general jet direction, suggesting a predominantly toroidal
magnetic field, in agreement with the presence of a helical magnetic field.
Ground-space fringes were detected up to a projected baseline length of $\sim
8$G$\lambda$, achieving the angular resolution of around 26$\mu$as. The
fine-scale structure of the relativistic jet is found in our study extending to
a projected distance of $\sim 180$ parsec from the radio core. However, the
filamentary structure reported by previous RadioAstron observations of 2014 is
not detected in our current study. We discuss potential causes for this
phenomenon, together with a comparison using public 43 GHz data from the
BEAM-ME program, showing a significant drop in the jet's total intensity. The
optically thick core is observed with a brightness temperature of $ 1.6 \times
10^{12}$ K, consistent with equipartition between the energy densities of the
relativistic particles and the magnetic field. This yields an estimated
magnetic field strength of 0.2 G.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are compelling candidates for dark matter and
potential portals to new physics beyond the Standard Model. Photons traversing
magnetized regions can convert into ALPs, producing characteristic,
energy-dependent absorption features in astrophysical spectra. The probability
of such conversions depends sensitively on both the photon energy and the
properties of the intervening magnetic fields.
  Most existing searches have focused on individual astrophysical sources, but
uncertainties in the structure and strength of cosmic magnetic fields have
limited their reach. Recently, we have demonstrated that active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) observed through galaxy clusters provide especially promising targets
for ALP searches. By stacking multiple AGN-cluster sightlines, one can average
over poorly known magnetic field configurations in galaxy clusters and recover
a distinctive ALP-induced spectral suppression, thereby significantly enhancing
sensitivity.
  In this work, we investigate a possible systematic uncertainty in such
analyses: the intrinsic time-variability of AGN spectra. We demonstrate that
AGN flux variability is correlated with spectral hardness, and that
time-averaging over flaring and quiescent states can potentially mimic the
suppression features imprinted by ALP-photon mixing. Our findings imply that
the recent constraints remain conservative, and that incorporating detailed
spectral variability into stacking analyses can further sharpen the search for
axion-like particles.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The death of massive stars is accompanied by the formation of central and
accreting compact objects and the subsequent launch of relativistic jets.
However, not all jets successfully drill their way out of the stellar envelope.
Unsuccessful jets, also known as choked jets, may still produce radiation at
lower frequencies by dissipating the jet energy into a pressurized cocoon. This
cocoon expands within the stellar envelope and eventually breaks out as a
mildly relativistic outflow. We investigate the plasma physics in the
surroundings of massive collapsing stars harboring choked jets via
relativistic, non-resistive MHD simulations. As a result, we define the
parameter space allowing for jets to remain choked, and we quantify the
acceleration rate and efficiency for charged particles in the strong shocks of
such astrophysical environments. Preliminary results show that high Mach
numbers ($\sim 100$) after 5-10 seconds of constant energy injection
characterize the forward shock, possibly allowing for efficient particle
acceleration and high-energy neutrino production. Our results are presented for
blue supergiant progenitors.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study synchrotron polarization in spatially resolved horizon-scale images,
such as those produced by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). In both general
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations as well as simplified
models of the black hole magnetosphere, the polarization angle, quantified by
the complex observable arg(beta_2), depends strongly and systematically on the
black hole spin. This relationship arises from the coupling between spin and
the structure of the magnetic field in the emission region, and it can be
computed analytically in the force-free limit. To explore this connection
further, we develop a semi-analytic inflow framework that solves the time
stationary axisymmetric equations of GRMHD in the black hole's equatorial
plane; this model can interpolate between the force-free and inertial regimes
by varying the magnetization of the inflow. Our model demonstrates how finite
inertia modifies the structure of the electromagnetic field and can be used to
quantitatively predict the observed polarization pattern. By comparing reduced
models, GRMHD simulations, and analytic limits, we show that the observed
synchrotron polarization can serve as a robust diagnostic of spin under
assumptions about Faraday rotation and the emission geometry. Applied to EHT
data, the model disfavors high-spin configurations for both M87* and Sgr A*,
highlighting the potential of polarimetric imaging as a probe of both black
hole spin and near-horizon plasma physics.
