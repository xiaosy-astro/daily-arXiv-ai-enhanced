Tidal disruptions of white dwarfs by intermediate mass black\nholes, mergers of black holes and Wolf-Rayet stars, and failed supernovae are\namong the suggestions. In this paper, we explore the viability of very massive\nstar core-collapse events as the origin of LFBOTs. The appeal of such a model\nis that the formation of massive black holes via core collapse may yield\nobservational signatures that can match the disparate lines of evidence that\npoint towards both core-collapse and tidal disruption origins for LFBOTs. We\nexplore the formation rate of massive black holes in population synthesis\nmodels, and compare the metallicities of their progenitors with the observed\nmetallicities of LFBOT host galaxies. We further examine the composition, mass\nloss rates and fallback masses of these stars, placing them in the context of\nLFBOT observations. The formation rate of black holes with mass greater than\n~30-40Msol is similar to the observed LFBOT rate. The stars producing these\nblack holes are biased to low metallicity (Z<0.3Zsol), are H and He-poor and\nhave dense circumstellar media. However, some LFBOTs have host galaxies with\nhigher metallicities than predicted, and others have denser environments\n(plausibly due to late mass loss not captured in the models). We find that\nlong-lived emission from an accretion disc (as implicated in the prototypical\nLFBOT AT2018cow) can plausibly be produced in these events. We conclude that\n(very) massive star core-collapse is a plausible explanation for LFBOTs. The\npreferred progenitors for LFBOTs in this scenario overlap with those predicted\nto produce super-kilonovae. We therefore suggest that LFBOTs are promising\ntargets to search for super-kilonovae, and that they may contribute\nnon-negligibly to the r-process enrichment of galaxies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We carried out a detailed\nnumerical study to explore the dynamics of the interaction between the ejecta\nof a supernova explosion and a relativistic extragalactic jet. By means of\nrelativistic hydrodynamics simulations using the code RATPENAT, we simulated\nthe jet-ejecta interaction in two different geometries or scenarios: a\ntwo-dimensional, axisymmetric simulation, and a three-dimensional one, which\nincludes the orbital velocity of the exploding star. Although initially filling\na region much smaller than the jet radius, the ejecta expands and eventually\ncovers most of the jet cross section. The expansion is enhanced as more energy\nfrom the jet is converted into kinetic and internal energy of the ejecta, which\nalso favors the ejecta disruption, all this occurring on timescales ~ 10^4 yr.\nAlthough a complete numerical convergence of the results is unattainable given\nthe subsonic, turbulent nature of the interaction region, the simulations are\nconsistent in their description of the gross morphological and dynamical\nproperties of the interaction process. At the end of the simulations, the\nsupernova ejecta has already partially mixed with the relativistic jet.

The improved\nsensitivity to plasma effects provided by DR2low also favors the identification\nof significant CN4 in eight pulsars, while none showed such evidence in\nDR2new+.

As PWNe emit photons over a broad range of\nthe electromagnetic spectrum, multiwavelength (MWL) studies are crucial for the\ninvestigation and study of their emission.\n  In this vein we present a joint eROSITA X-ray and H.E.S.S. gamma-ray study of\nthe PWN MSH 15-52. We showcase our custom code for integrating the EDR and DR1\neROSITA data into the Gammapy framework, a python package optimised for the\nanalysis of gamma-ray data.

Among various\ncandidates, the weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) scenario stands\nout and is under extensive study. The detection of the hypothetical gamma-ray\nemission from WIMP annihilation could act as a direct probe of\nelectroweak-scale interactions, complementing DM collider searches and other\ndirect DM detection techniques. At very high energies (VHE), WIMP\nself-annihilation is expected to produce gamma rays together with other\nStandard Model particles. The galactic center (GC), due to its relative\nproximity to the Earth and its high expected DM density, is a prime target for\nmonoenergetic line searches. IACTs have placed strong constraints on the DM\nproperties at the GC, with the MAGIC providing the most stringent limits from\n20 TeV to 100 TeV, exploiting large zenith angle (LZA) observations. However,\nthe limited field of view (FoV) of the MAGIC telescopes (< 3.5{\\deg} )\nprevented a detailed study of the extended region around the GC in which an\nenhanced DM density is expected. The LST-1 of the CTAO, located at the Roque de\nLos Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain), close to the MAGIC site, has been\nobserving the GC since 2021. With its wide FoV of 4.5{\\deg}, LST-1 could\ncontribute significantly to the WIMPs search at the GC. The observations are\nperformed at LZA (ZA > 58{\\deg}), which, while required due to the source's low\naltitude, also optimizes the detection of gamma rays up to 100 TeV and beyond.\nWe present a study of the systematic uncertainties in WIMP line emission\nsearches with LST-1.
