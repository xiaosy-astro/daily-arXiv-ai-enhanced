Using Monte Carlo simulations with MONACO, we solve three-dimensional\nradiative transfer equations to determine the large-scale ionization structure\nthat produces the observed ionic column densities. Focusing on the high/soft\nstate of the BH XRB, where disk emission provides the dominant source of\nionizing X-rays, we calculated synthetic spectra showing resonance absorption\nand scattered emission from ions in various charge states. Our results\ndemonstrate that systems viewed at high polar angles exhibit prominent\nmulti-ion absorption lines with asymmetric profiles, accompanied by\nP-Cygni-like emission features that partially reproduce the characteristics\nseen in the observed spectra. This further implies that even a dense disk wind\nwith a high polar angle is unlikely to be saturated due to effective\nscattering."}

We generated\nconsistent energy-resolved pulse profiles for each observation, as well as\nprofiles built from subsets of individual pulse cycles selected by time, flux,\nor similarity to the mean profiles. We identified five pulsed phases based on\nthe profile morphology and hardness, and examined the relative contributions\nover time.

The pulse profile of Vela X-1, when averaged over many pulse\ncycles, remains remarkably stable, as expected. The most prominent variations\nbetween epochs are attributable to changes in absorption.

Representing\nonly $\\sim$1-3\\% of all core-collapse SNe and often found in low-metallicity\nenvironments, their large diversity suggests a wide range of progenitor and\nexplosion properties. This study aims to improve the understanding of\n1987A-like SNe by characterizing their explosion parameters, including kinetic\nenergy, ejected mass, progenitor radius at explosion, and synthesized $^{56}$Ni\nmass. Additionally, it seeks to identify systematic trends in both the physical\nproperties and the observed features of these peculiar events. A new Bayesian\nparameter estimation method, based on our $^{56}$Ni-dependent analytical model\nfor hydrogen-rich SNe, is applied to derive explosion parameters from the light\ncurves and expansion velocities of one of the largest and most comprehensive\n1987A-like SN samples to date. These data are measured through a consistent\nanalysis of observations available in the literature. The analysis reveals a\nheterogeneous population that nevertheless clusters into two main groups: (i)\nlower-energy explosions with modest $^{56}$Ni yields ($\\sim$0.07~M$_\\odot$),\nsimilar to SN~1987A, and (ii) more energetic events (up to $\\sim$5~foe) with\nlarger nickel production and, in some cases, unusually extended progenitors.

Our study underscores the need to extend\nanalytical frameworks to include additional power sources, enabling scalable\nand accurate modelling of the growing number of peculiar transients."}

They could be generated either by a\nforward shock (FS) propagating into diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM), or a\nbow shock (BS) around a dense cloud, each of which is fundamentally different.\nTo elucidate the distinctions between these two scenarios, we conducted\ntwo-fluid simulations incorporating relativistic electrons to investigate the\nspatial evolution of these electrons after being accelerated by shock. Based on\ntheir spatial distribution, we performed radiative transfer calculations to\nobtain the synchrotron spectra. In Paper I (Mou 2025), we reported the results\nfor the FS scenario; in this article, we focus on the BS scenario. Compared to\nthat from the FS, the radio emission from the BS exhibits a higher peak\nfrequency, and its flux shows a much steeper rise and a more rapid decline. The\nradio flux from the BS also responds to fluctuations in the outflow. The\ncombined effects of the BS and FS substantially alter radio spectra, causing\nsignificant deviations from the single-zone emission model, and in some cases\nproducing double-peaked or flat-top features in spectra. This study highlights\nthe importance of the BS, and inspires a novel approach for probing dense gas\non sub-parsec scales in galactic nuclei by decomposing the BS radio spectrum to\nreveal the conditions of circumnuclear dense gas."}

This work considers data mainly from a muon telescope system which\ncan respond to both unaccompanied muons and small cosmic ray air showers,\nproviding data from GeV to mid-TeV energies, where the Forbush Decrease ceases\nto be statistically observable. This paper examines the depth of the flux\nDecrease, as a fraction below its quiescent value, over that primary energy\nrange. The progressive development of internal time structure in the flux\nthrough the seven days of the phenomenon is also demonstrated."}

In recent\nyears, however, it has evolved to resemble a Type-2 or Compton-thick AGN.\nHerein, we report on the first XRISM observation of GRS 1915$+$105. The\nhigh-resolution Resolve calorimeter spectrum reveals that a sub-Eddington\ncentral engine is covered by a layer of warm, Compton-thick gas. With the\nobscuration acting as a coronagraph, numerous strong, narrow emission lines\nfrom He-like and H-like charge states of Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni\ndominate the spectrum. Radiative recombination continuum (RRC) features are\nalso observed, signaling that much of the emitting gas is photoionized. The\nline spectrum can be fit by three photoionized emission zones, with broadening\nand bulk velocities suggestive of an origin in the outer disk atmosphere and/or\na slow wind at $r \\simeq 10^{6}~GM/c^{2}$. The Fe XXV He-$\\alpha$ and Fe XXVI\nLy-$\\alpha$ lines have a broad base that may indicate some emission from $r\n\\sim 3\\times 10^{3}~GM/c^{2}$. These results broadly support a picture wherein\nthe current state in GRS 1915$+$105 is due to obscuration by the irradiated\nouter disk. This could arise through disk thickening if the Eddington fraction\nis higher than inferred, but it is more likely due to a warped, precessing disk\nthat has brought the outer disk into the line of sight. We discuss the\nstrengths and weaknesses of this interpretation and our modeling, and possible\nexplanations of some potentially novel spectral features."}

However, Magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is the primary cause\nof turbulence in ADs. Significant velocity variations and rapid pressure\nchanges are characteristics of turbulent flows, which allow better mixing and\nmore angular momentum (AM) and energy transfer. Also, in accretion flow (AF),\nthe interaction between turbulence and resistivity determines the efficiency of\nenergy dissipation and heat transfer. Radiation, convection, and thermal\nconduction (TC) are the heat transport modes existing in AFs, where TC enables\nenergy transfer in accreting materials via heat flux. Moreover, convection,\nalso generated by turbulence, significantly impacts the stability of the AD and\nits vertical structure. The disc may be affected by radiation from the AD\nsurrounding the BH when X-ray emission occurs. The emission from the disc is\nalso affected by dust particles. Dust grains near BH are exposed to high\ntemperatures and intense radiation, which might affect the flow\ncharacteristics, as seen in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This chapter\nhighlights the combined effect of turbulence, resistivity, transport\nmechanisms, and dust particles on BH AF. Future studies in this field must\nthoroughly investigate how dust, transport mechanisms, and turbulence interact\nin the BH accretion system."}

It detected about 930000 sources, providing us with an unprecedented\nopportunity for a detailed blazar census. We present the properties of blazars\nand blazar candidates in eRASS1 and the compilation of the eROSITA blazar\ncatalog. Methods. We compile a list of blazar and blazar candidates from the\nliterature and match it with the eRASS1 catalog, creating the Blazars in eRASS1\n(BlazEr1) catalog. For sources with more than 50 counts we obtain their X-ray\nspectral properties. We compile multiwavelength data from the radio to the\ngamma-ray regimes for all sources, including multiwavelength spectral indices\nand redshifts. The full catalog is available online. Results. We present the\nBlazEr1 catalog, containing 5865 sources, of which 2106 are associated with\nconfirmed blazars. For 3668 sources, eROSITA provides the first X-ray data. The\ncontamination from non-blazar sources of the entire sample is less than 11%.\nMost candidates exhibit properties typical for blazars.

This paradigm has recently been challenged by the\nidentification of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies, thought to be young\nactive galactic nuclei with low-mass black holes, harboring relativistic jets.\nAmong them, sources hosting $>$100 kpc radio jets are extremely rare. Here, we\nreport the discovery of large-scale, double-lobed radio structures in 33 NLSy1s\nwith the projected linear size of at least 100 kpc from a recently published\ncatalog of 22656 NLSy1 galaxies. These 33 include 29 confirmed double-lobed\nsources and 4 candidates whose radio structure requires further study. We\nsuggest that their low black hole masses are unlikely to be due to their small\nangles of inclination to the line of sight. These enigmatic sources were\nidentified by examining the radio observations taken with the Faint Images of\nthe Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters, Very Large Array Sky Survey, Low Frequency\nArray, and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey. Among them, the NLSy1 source\nJ1318+2626 ($z=0.62$) is found to host a radio jet with the projected linear\nsize of 4.3 Mpc, making it the only NLSy1 galaxy hosting a Mpc-scale radio jet\nknown as of today. We conclude that future observations of NLSy1 sources with\nthe next generation of sensitive telescopes may reveal a much larger population\nharboring large-scale jets, thus providing crucial clues on their origin,\npropagation, and interaction with the ambient environment."}
