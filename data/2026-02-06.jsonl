Accepted in A&A as a Letter", "summary": "We report the discovery of complex flaring activity from the galactic nucleus hosting the five-year-old tidal disruption event eRASSt J234402.9-352640 (J2344). With Einstein Probe and XMM-Newton observations, we detected highly structured soft X-ray variability. Through temporal decomposition of the XMM-Newton light curve and time-resolved spectral analysis, we identified broad, thermal flares recurring every $\\sim$12 hours and lasting $\\sim$2 hours, consistent with quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs). Remarkably, these QPEs are accompanied by an unprecedented crest of hotter, shorter flares, each lasting between 5 and 30 minutes. These flares are predominantly found in the rising phases of the QPEs, although they also appear throughout the quiescence. These findings establish J2344 as a new member of the QPE emitter population and uncover a previously unobserved phenomenology that challenges current models of QPEs. In this letter, we present the phenomenological properties of this unique source and discuss possible interpretations within the framework of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals."}

We tested a baseline case and demonstrated strong agreement in the behavior of the outgoing spectrum's color-correction factor with earlier work and theoretical expectations. By analyzing the relationship between the simulation time and outgoing flux, we also demonstrated how the model calculates through a sequence of time-independent atmospheric snapshots, each iteratively refined, and uses them to progressively converge toward the correct atmospheric state (as would be observed during a burst). We examined the behavior of the outgoing flux across different optical depths and explored the physical explanations for deviations from a pure blackbody spectrum, attributed to frequency-dependent opacity sources. Additionally, we assessed the impact of Compton scattering, highlighting its role in redistributing photon energies."}

BBH mergers embedded in AGN disks are unique among GW formation channels in their generic ability to produce electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, via interactions between the merger remnant and the surrounding disk gas (though these are not always observable). While such mergers represent valuable multi-messenger sources, the lack of predictive statistical models in existing literature currently limits our ability to select possible EM counterparts with GW detections in archival data and in real time using time-domain surveys such as ZTF or LSST. Here, we employ the Monte Carlo For AGN Channel Testing and Simulation code (\\texttt{McFACTS}\\footnote{https://www.github.com/mcfacts/mcfacts}) to predict the bolometric luminosities of jets and shocks associated with LVK-detectable BBH merger remnants in AGN disks. \\texttt{McFACTS} predicts the distribution of GW observables for an underlying BH population and disk model. In this work we present a new capability that simultaneously generates the distribution of bolometric EM luminosities corresponding to these predicted GW detections. We show that (i) migration traps in dense, Sirko-Goodman-like AGN disks efficiently drive hierarchical BH mergers, yielding high-mass, high-spin BH remnants capable of powering observable EM counterparts across merger generations; and ii) mergers embedded in sufficiently dense disks with chirp mass $\\mathcal{M}\\gtrsim40M_\\odot$ are highly likely to yield observable EM counterparts for sufficiently long-lived disks and top-heavy BH initial mass functions."}

In this work, we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024abfl, a SN IIP in NGC 2146 with a directly detected red supergiant (RSG) progenitor. We find it has a low plateau luminosity ($M_V \\sim -15$ mag) and a relatively long plateau length ($\\sim 126.5$ days). By fitting a semi-analytical model, we estimated a $^{56}$Ni mass of $\\sim 0.009 M_\\odot$, an initial kinetic energy of $\\sim 0.42$ foe, an initial thermal energy of $\\sim 0.03$ foe and an ejecta mass of $\\sim 8.3 M_\\odot$. The spectral evolution of SN 2024abfl is similar to those of other SNe IIP, except for much lower ejecta velocities at similar epochs. At later epochs, we find a relatively high-velocity H$α$ absorption feature at $\\sim -4000$ km s$^{-1}$, possibly due to a fast-moving plume of matter in the inner ejecta, and two emission features at $\\pm 2000$ km s$^{-1}$, possibly caused by CSM interaction. We estimate the progenitor mass to be $\\le 15 M_\\odot$ based on nebular spectra. We conclude that SN 2024abfl is a low-luminosity SN IIP originating from a low-mass RSG progenitor."}

In the limit of a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a zero-net angular momentum flow, accretion is spherical. However, in the presence of a large-scale vertical magnetic field, the classical Bondi accretion model is significantly altered. The frozen-in field is stretched radially as the plasma is pulled inward by gravity. This continues until the restoring force from the magnetic tension suddenly expels the material and resets the field, allowing a new cycle to begin. Although this scenario has been well depicted in previous studies, it remains incomplete as the issues of dissipation and particle acceleration are not yet fully resolved. In this work, we aim to revisit these issues with a first-principles kinetic plasma model. We perform two-dimensional global general relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole, for both pair and electron-ion plasmas. The simulations are evolved over long timescales to capture multiple flux eruption events and establish a quasi-steady state. For each accretion cycle, we find that the system goes through three main stages: (i) an ideal advection phase where magnetic flux through the horizon increases quasi-linearly with time; (ii) a reconnection-regulated phase where the net increase of the flux is slowed down by intermittent reconnection events near the horizon; and (iii) a flaring phase when a major, large-scale reconnection event expels the flux, leading to efficient particle acceleration. The emergence of large-amplitude quasi-periodic flux eruptions and concomitant particle acceleration is reminiscent of Sgr A* flaring activity. This phenomenon could also be applicable to quiescent black holes, especially isolated black holes accreting the interstellar medium."}

MeV $γ$-ray line observations provide the most direct evidence for ongoing nucleosynthesis in galaxies by measuring freshly produced radioactive isotopes from massive stars, supernovae, classical novae, or binary neutron star mergers. Their flux ratios can determine the low-energy cosmic-ray spectrum in different objects and of the Milky Way as a whole. Different phases of the interstellar medium are traced by hot nucleosynthesis ejecta, cooling positrons, or cosmic-ray interactions with molecular clouds. Positron annihilation itself can be considered as an astrophysical messenger as their production and destruction in typical space environments is inevitable. Finally, as-of-yet unknown signatures from beyond standard model physics might have their elusive imprints in $γ$-ray lines. This Chapter gives an overview of historical $γ$-ray line measurements, newest results, and open questions that may only be solved by a new generation of MeV telescopes."}

Submitted to The Astrophysical Journal", "summary": "We present a detailed broadband afterglow study of GRB 220101A ($10^4\\lesssimΔT\\lesssim10^7$ s) combining multi-wavelength data from soft X-rays until 6 GHz. The afterglow light curves in both X-ray and optical show distinct steepening around $\\sim9$ days, followed by a sharp post-break decay index of $\\sim2.99\\pm0.10$. We fit the light curves using the afterglow modelling package \\texttt{afterglowpy} for both Top-hat and Gaussian jets for different values of the electronic participation fraction $ξ$ from 0.01 to 1.0 and find that, although the radio behavior is well described by the $ξ=1.0$ case, the required circumburst medium (CBM) densities are very low, $<10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$. However, the resulting energy requirements are modest, $\\sim10^{52}$ erg, with an electron energy distribution (EED) index $p\\sim2.05$. Similar results are also obtained from an analytic model fit to the light curve, except the predicted $p$ is higher, $\\sim2.40$. The observed post-break decay index of $2.99$ is at least 5$σ$ away from $p$, which is one of the steepest observed so far. We also find that when ignoring the radio observations, the CBM density is raised by a few orders of magnitude to $\\sim0.01$ cm$^{-3}$ for $ξ=1.0$, still far from the expected ISM density ($>1$ cm$^{-3}$) of GRB environments, which are highly star forming regions. Similarly low ISM densities have been seen in modeling of other LAT GRBs as well, especially ones with reverse-shock features (e.g., GRBs 130427A, 160509A and 160625B), thereby hinting at either an issue with the standard model or possible evacuated cavities where GRBs explode."}
