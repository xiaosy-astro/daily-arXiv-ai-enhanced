Motivation: 为了校准距离尺度并精确测量该特殊重复GRB的γ射线能量释放，从而更准确地了解其物理特性和在宇宙中的分布情况。

Method: 使用JWST的NIRSpec仪器进行长时间观测，识别出一致的氢发射线以确定红移，分析宿主星系的性质并排除伴随超新星的可能性。

Result: 确认了红移$z = 1.036 	ext{±}0.004$，得出γ射线能量释放至少为$E_{m 	ext{iso}} = 2.2 	imes 10^{54}$ erg，未发现持续的瞬时发射或与之相当的伴超新星。

Abstract: We present follow-up observations of the day-long, repeating GRB 250702B with
the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST). Through the identification of narrow hydrogen emission lines
at a consistent redshift of $z = 1.036 \pm 0.004$, we calibrate the distance
scale, and therefore the energetics, of this unique extragalactic transient. At
this distance, the resulting $\gamma$-ray energy release is at least
$E_{\gamma,\rm iso} = 2.2 \times 10^{54}$\,erg. We find no evidence for ongoing
transient emission at the GRB position, and exclude any accompanying supernova
with a luminosity comparable to the Type Ic broad-line SN 2023lcr, though we
are unable to constrain fainter events. The inferred rate of such events,
assuming at most one in the lifetime of {\em Fermi}, suggests that such bursts
are very rare, with volumetric rates $>1,000$ times lower than normal high
luminosity long GRBs and $> 10^5$ times lower than core collapse supernovae
when corrected for beaming. Furthermore, we find that the host galaxy is unique
amongst GRB host galaxies, and extremely rare in the general galaxy population,
being extremely large, dusty and with high stellar mass. The identification of
such an exotic GRB in such an unusual galaxy raises the possibility that the
environment was important in the progenitor channel for this event.

### [2] [Ultra-long Gamma-ray Bursts from Micro-Tidal Disruption Events: The Case of GRB 250702B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22779)
*Paz Beniamini,Hagai B. Perets,Jonathan Granot*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: GRB 250702B is identified as a micro-tidal disruption event ($\mu$TDE) involving a stellar-mass black hole or neutron star disrupting a main-sequence star.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the unique characteristics of GRB 250702B, such as multi-hour prompt emission, X-ray precursor, off-nuclear host position, and hard gamma-ray emission, which are difficult to account for by standard ULGRB models.

Method: The study investigates three potential pathways for micro-tidal disruption events: dynamical partial/repeating disruption, natal-kick disruption, and hybrid natal-kick + partial case, analyzing their ability to reproduce the observed precursor-main flare delay and other phenomena.

Result: The three $\mu$TDE pathways can account for the observed delays and emission properties. Cross-section scalings suggest comparable rates for partial and full disruptions in dynamical and natal-kick scenarios. The hard and variable gamma-ray emission is consistent with a stellar-mass compact object.

Conclusion: Micro-tidal disruption events provide a viable framework for explaining ULGRBs like GRB 250702B, offering observational discriminants to differentiate between the three proposed pathways.

Abstract: Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (ULGRBs), a rare class of high-energy transients
with durations $>10^3$,s, remain poorly understood. GRB,250702B ($z=1.04$) is
notable for its multi-hour prompt emission, an X-ray precursor $\sim$1 day
earlier, off-nuclear host position, and hard, rapidly variable gamma-rays. This
combination is difficult to explain with standard ULGRB progenitors such as
blue-supergiant collapsars, magnetar engines, or white-dwarf tidal disruptions
by intermediate-mass black holes. We interpret the event as a micro-tidal
disruption event ($\mu$TDE), where a stellar-mass black hole or neutron star
partially or fully disrupts a main-sequence star. Three $\mu$TDE pathways can
reproduce the observed precursor-main flare delay: (i) a \emph{dynamical
(partial/repeating)} disruption, in which a grazing passage yields a faint
precursor and the core returns after $\sim$day for a deeper encounter; (ii) a
\emph{natal-kick} disruption, where the delay reflects the ballistic motion of
a newborn compact object relative to its companion, leading to full disruption;
and (iii) a \emph{hybrid natal-kick + partial} case, in which the kick seeds
the close encounter but the first passage is only partial, with the core
returning on the day-scale period. Cross-section scalings imply comparable
rates for partial and full outcomes in both dynamical and natal-kick scenarios.
The highly variable, hard $\gamma$-ray emission supports association with a
stellar-mass compact object. Fallback and viscous accretion naturally explain
the ultra-long duration, energetics, and ks-scale X-ray variability. We outline
observational discriminants between the three channels and argue that $\mu$TDEs
offer a compelling framework for ULGRBs such as GRB 250702B.

TL;DR: This paper presents an analysis of GRB 250702B's afterglow and host galaxy, suggesting an exotic progenitor possibly involving galaxy mergers or tidal disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the origin of the longest gamma-ray burst ever observed (GRB 250702B), which challenges standard collapsar models.

Method: The study used optical and infrared follow-up observations from various telescopes to analyze the afterglow and host galaxy's properties.

Result: The afterglow matches forward shock emission from a highly obscured relativistic jet. The host galaxy is massive, dusty, and asymmetric, indicating a major merger. The data does not conclusively determine the progenitor type.

Conclusion: The findings support multiple possible progenitor scenarios, including a collapsar, star-black hole merger, or tidal disruption by a black hole.

Abstract: GRB 250702B was the longest gamma-ray burst ever observed, with a duration
that challenges standard collapsar models and suggests an exotic progenitor. We
collected a rich set of optical and infrared follow-up observations of its
rapidly fading afterglow using a suite of telescopes including the W. M. Keck
Observatory, the Gemini telescopes, the Magellan Baade Telescope, the Victor M.
Blanco 4-meter telescope, and the Fraunhofer Telescope at Wendelstein
Observatory. Our analysis reveals that the afterglow emission is well described
by forward shock emission from a highly obscured relativistic jet. Deep
photometric observations of the host galaxy reveal a massive 10^10.66 solar
masses, dusty, and extremely asymmetric system that is consistent with two
galaxies undergoing a major merger. The galactocentric offset, host galaxy
properties, and jet characteristics do not definitively distinguish between
competing progenitor scenarios. We find that the afterglow and host are
consistent with a range of progenitors including a collapsar, a merger between
a helium star and a stellar mass black hole, the disruption of a star by a
stellar mass compact object, and the tidal disruption of a star by an
off-nuclear intermediate mass black hole.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: GRB 250702B is an exceptional transient that produced multiple episodes of
luminous gamma-ray radiation lasting for $>25$ ks, placing it among the class
of ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, unlike any known GRB, a soft
X-ray precursor was discovered by the Einstein Probe up to 24 hours before the
gamma-ray triggers. We present comprehensive X-ray observations of the
transient's afterglow obtained with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, the
Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory
between 0.5 to 65 days (observer frame) after the initial high-energy trigger.
The X-ray emission decays steeply as $\sim t^{-1.9}$, and shows short timescale
X-ray variability ($\Delta T/T < 0.03$) in both Swift and NuSTAR, consistent
with flares superposed on an external shock continuum. Serendipitous detections
by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) out to $\sim$0.3 days and continued
NuSTAR variability to $\sim$2 days imply sustained central engine activity;
including the precursor, the required engine duration is $\gtrsim 3$ days.
Afterglow modeling favors the combination of forward and reverse shock emission
in a wind-like ($k \approx 2$) environment. These properties, especially the
long-lived engine and soft X-ray precursor, are difficult to reconcile with a
collapsar origin, and GRB 250702B does not fit neatly with canonical ultra-long
GRBs or relativistic tidal disruption events (TDEs). A hybrid scenario in which
a star is disrupted by a stellar-mass black hole (a micro-TDE) provides a
plausible explanation, although a relativistic TDE from an intermediate-mass
black hole remains viable. Decisive discrimination between progenitors will
require sensitive late-time X-ray observations.

TL;DR: 发现了一个持续约25,000秒的最长时间的伽马射线暴GRB 250702B，其性质与常规伽马射线暴不同，认为其可能源于氦星合并模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻找和研究超长伽马射线暴（ULGRBs）的新的可能来源，以解释它们与已知模型不一致的特性。

Method: 使用四个仪器在星际网络和全天空X射线成像监测器的数据来分析GRB 250702B。

Result: 发现该伽马射线暴具有硬光谱、亚秒级变化和高总能量，这些性质仅见于由快速旋转的恒星级中心引擎驱动的极端相对论喷流。

Conclusion: GRB 250702B为氦星合并模型提供了自然解释，支持了氦星膨胀和某些超长伽马射线暴与坍缩星、恒星级引力波源及罕见超新星具有相似演化路径的观点。

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts are the most luminous electromagnetic events in the
universe. Their prompt gamma-ray emission has typical durations between a
fraction of a second and several minutes. A rare subset of these events have
durations in excess of a thousand seconds, referred to as ultra-long gamma-ray
bursts. Here, we report the discovery of the longest gamma-ray burst ever seen
with a ~25,000 s gamma-ray duration, GRB 250702B, and characterize this event
using data from four instruments in the InterPlanetary Network and the Monitor
of All-sky X-ray Image. We find a hard spectrum, subsecond variability, and
high total energy, which are only known to arise from ultrarelativistic jets
powered by a rapidly-spinning stellar-mass central engine. These properties and
the extreme duration are together incompatible with all confirmed gamma-ray
burst progenitors and nearly all models in the literature. This burst is
naturally explained with the helium merger model, where a field binary ends
when a black hole falls into a stripped star and proceeds to consume and
explode it from within. Under this paradigm, GRB 250702B adds to the growing
evidence that helium stars expand and that some ultra-long GRBs have similar
evolutionary pathways as collapsars, stellar-mass gravitational wave sources,
and potentially rare types of supernovae.

Motivation: 研究旨在利用引力透镜作为高分辨率望远镜，探讨遥远类星体中X射线和光学发射区域的空间起源，以增进对类星体结构和活动星系核特性的理解。

Method: 研究使用Gaia DR3和HST观测数据建立透镜质量模型，结合存档的Chandra观测数据，通过贝叶斯方法测试X射线发射区域是否与质量模型预测的光学源位置一致。

Result: X射线发射区域被限制在一个0.030 x 0.020角秒的椭圆内，置信度达到99.7%，最大可能距离为44.7毫角秒。该方法提高了Chandra在高红移区域的空间分辨率约6倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为研究高红移类星体的复杂形态提供了新途径，并展示了未来宽带和光谱分辨的X射线天体测量研究在发现双源和二元活动星系核候选体方面的潜力。

Abstract: We perform milliarcsecond X-ray astrometry of the quadruply lensed
radio-quiet quasar GraL J065904.1+162909 (J0659). This z = 3.083 quasar is
lensed into four images and was discovered with the second Data Release of the
Gaia Space Observatory (Gaia DR2). The methodology of using gravitational
lenses as high resolution telescopes has been applied, so far, to five lensed
quasars (including J0659) and shows potential to elucidate the spatial origin
of the X-ray and optical emitting regions in distant quasars. We use Gaia DR3
and HST observations of J0659 and infer a mass model for the deflector that
reproduces the positions of the quasar lensed images to milliarcsecond
precision. Next, we apply archival Chandra observations of J0659, together with
our lens model, to conduct a Bayesian test evaluating whether the X-ray
emitting region coincides with the optical source position predicted by our
mass model. We constrain the origin of the X-ray emission to be within a
0.''030 x 0.''020 ellipse at the 99.7% level, finding the maximum possible
distance between the X-ray and optical source is 44.7 milliarcseconds. Our
methodology enhances Chandra's spatial resolution at high-z by a factor of 6.
We provide a novel approach that extends the methodology towards investigating
the origin of the soft and hard X-ray emitting regions in lensed quasars. We
elaborate on the potential of upcoming broadband and spectrally resolved X-ray
astrometric studies to probe complex quasar morphology at high-z and to
identify dual and binary AGN candidates.

Conclusion: 这项研究为开发半解析方案以计算核心坍缩超新星和中子星合并遗迹的水动力模拟中的味道转换物理提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The streaming of neutrinos in an inhomogeneous medium is known to affect the
physics of flavor conversion. We employ an ensemble of single-crossed angular
distributions and explore the physics of flavor conversion, while neutrinos
propagate across a one-dimensional inhomogeneous medium. The advective term in
the neutrino equations of motion is responsible for the cascade of flavor waves
towards ever smaller spatial and angular scales. However, as the system
evolves, perturbations with large wavenumbers are damped, with a resulting
smearing of the flavor configuration. We provide a simple recipe that allows to
forecast the steady-state flavor configuration achieved by neutrinos without
solving their kinetic equations. In particular, we find that flavor
equipartition on one side of the angular spectrum and the cancellation of the
spectral crossing in the lepton number distributions, proposed in the
literature as generic flavor outcome, is a special solution depending on the
degree of neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry. This work constitutes a step forward
towards the development of semi-analytic schemes to account for flavor
conversion physics in hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae and
neutron-star merger remnants.

### [8] [Can GRB 250702B be explained as the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole? Yes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22843)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: GRB 250702B is a repeating gamma-ray burst with unusual properties, including X-ray, radio, and infrared counterparts. The authors suggest it can be explained by a white dwarf tidally stripped by an intermediate mass black hole over multiple orbits, with gamma-ray emission resulting from collisions of debris streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unusual characteristics of GRB 250702B, such as its possible periodicity and the presence of X-ray, radio, and infrared counterparts, challenge existing models of high-energy transients, necessitating a new explanation.

Method: The study analyzes the properties of GRB 250702B, such as its periodic gamma-ray light curve, X-ray counterpart, and other multi-wavelength emissions, and compares them to a scenario where a white dwarf is tidally stripped by an intermediate mass black hole over multiple pericentre passages.

Result: The model is found to be consistent with the observed properties of GRB 250702B, particularly the X-ray, infrared, and radio emissions, as well as the gamma-ray emission resulting from debris stream collisions upscattered by the jet.

Conclusion: The analysis supports the hypothesis that GRB 250702B is caused by a white dwarf being tidally stripped by an intermediate mass black hole, with gamma-ray emission resulting from debris stream collisions and upscattering by the jet. Further study of the jet properties is necessary to refine the model.

Abstract: GRB 250702B is a unique astrophysical transient characterised by its nature
as a repeating gamma-ray trigger. Its properties include possible periodicity
in its gamma-ray light curve, an X-ray counterpart that rose prior to the
gamma-ray outbursts and faded quickly, and radio and infrared counterparts.
These features are difficult to reconcile with most models of high energy
transients but we show that they are compatible with a white dwarf bound to an
intermediate mass black hole that is tidally stripped over multiple pericentre
passages before being fully disrupted. Accretion onto the black hole powers a
mildly relativistic jet that produces the X-rays through internal processes and
the infrared and radio counterparts through thermal emission and external
shocks respectively but is unable to produce the gamma-ray emission on its own.
We propose that chaotic debris streams from the multiple stripping episodes can
collide with a period roughly the same as the orbital period of the star. These
shocks produce hard X-ray photons that are upscattered by the jet to produce
the observed gamma-ray emission. Future analysis of the jet properties will
allow us to place firmer constraints on our model.

Conclusion: 第谷超新星遗迹存在空间和时间上发展的湍流级联，为理解SNR中的湍流物理提供了重要见解。

Abstract: We investigate the turbulent structures in the Tycho supernova remnant (SNR)
by applying two-point autocorrelation and power spectral analyses to
high-resolution X-ray and radio images. Using cleaned Chandra and VLA data, we
derive two-dimensional (2D) and one-dimensional (1D) autocorrelation functions
and power spectra, revealing that the fluctuations in both X-ray brightness
(approximately tracing plasma density) and radio brightness (tracing magnetic
field strength) follow the power-law distributions consistent with
Kolmogorov-type turbulence. Specifically, power spectra exhibit a slope $8/3$
in 2D and $5/3$ in 1D analyses, indicating fully developed turbulence across a
broad range of spatial scales. The structure functions and spectral slopes
remain robust with and without correction for line-of-sight integration
effects, suggesting the presence of Kolmogorov-like turbulence locally
throughout the remnant's volume. Anisotropies in the 2D autocorrelation
function are aligned with known density and magnetic field gradients. Analysis
of the 1D radial properties of turbulence confirms Kolmogorov scaling and
indicates that modes in the power spectra may be related either to periodicity
in the fluctuations or to the physical sizes of bright or dim features in the
surface brightness. Our results demonstrate that the Tycho SNR hosts a
spatially and temporally developed turbulent cascade, providing insight into
the physics of turbulence in SNRs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Synchrotron radiation from the reverse- and forward-shock regions typically
describes the evolution of temporal and spectral features given by the closure
relations (CRs) during the late and long-/short-lasting emission in the
afterglow phase of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Although synchrotron photons are
restricted to keV and a few MeV energies, the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC)
mechanism can disperse them above hundreds of MeV energies. We present the CRs
of the SSC process radiated from the reverse-shock region for the case of a
thick and thin shell, considering that the reverse shock lies in the adiabatic
regime and evolves in an environment with a homogeneous and stratified medium.
We analyze these CRs with the spectral and temporal characteristics of the
bursts described in the second \textit{Fermi}-LAT GRB catalog (2FLGC) and found
that i) the thin shell case is preferred over a thick shell and a
constant-density medium over a stellar-wind environment, ii) bursts with an
atypical and hard spectral index could be successfully described by this
scenario in different cooling conditions, iii) the early optical flash and GeV
emission exhibited in GRB 160625B and 180720B were generated from the same
accelerated region and electron population, concluding that LAT emission
originated during the early afterglow, and iv) the maximum synchrotron energy
radiated from the reverse-shock scenario could explain only a few photons with
the exception of a pair of bursts, so that scattered photons by the SSC process
must be required.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the Terzina payload on the NUSES space mission, focusing on its design and challenges in detecting cosmic rays and atmospheric showers in space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a compact and efficient telescope for detecting high-energy cosmic rays (above a few hundred PeV) and atmospheric showers, which are important for understanding astrophysical phenomena.

Method: The telescope utilizes a Cherenkov Schmidt-Cassegrain design with a 640-pixel camera system and SiPMs. The paper addresses challenges like SiPM degradation from space radiation, DCR mitigation, luminous background characterization, and data acquisition strategies.

Result: The performance of the payload for cosmic ray signals above a few hundred PeV is illustrated. The work outlines how the challenges are being tackled, though specific quantitative results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the ongoing efforts to address technical challenges in the Terzina payload, emphasizing its role in advancing space-based cosmic ray detection and atmospheric studies.

Abstract: The Terzina payload, onboard the NUSES space mission is being built in
collaboration with TAS-I by GSSI, INFN and the University of Geneva. It is a
Cherenkov Schmidt-Cassegrain compact telescope with an effective focal length
of 925~mm and a camera focal assembly composed of 640 pixels (16 vertically and
40 horizontally) organized in $8\times 8$ tiles produced by FBK with sensitive
area $2.73 \times 2.64$~mm$^2$. We will illustrate the performance for the
signal of cosmic rays beyond a threshold of few hundreds of PeV. Understanding
the operation of SiPMs in space with almost direct exposure to solar and
trapped protons and electrons, defining the mitigation strategy for the
increase of DCR of exposed silicon, the characterisation of the luminous
backgrounds, the data acquisition strategy for this payload, the maximization
of the effective exposure to the atmospheric showers induced by the signal of
neutrinos and cosmic rays are the challenges. At this conference, we describe

Abstract: The origin of ear-like structures with two opposite lobes extending from the
shell of supernova remnants (SNRs) remains a subject of active debate, with
proposed mechanisms ranging from jet-driven explosions to interactions with
bipolar circumstellar media. We present a novel investigation using
Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations to examine the dynamics of a spherical
ejecta in magnetized media, revealing a different formation mechanism for these
structures. Our results demonstrate that particle acceleration is significantly
enhanced along the magnetic-field direction, producing substantial
modifications to shock morphology. These effects naturally generate elongated
protrusions bearing a remarkable similarity to the observed SNR ear structures.
This magnetic alignment scenario represents a distinct mechanism from the
existing jet-based and circumstellar interaction models. Our findings suggest
that magnetic field orientation may serve as a crucial diagnostic for
distinguishing between different ear formation mechanisms in SNRs.

Motivation: 为了利用BHEX空间望远镜更精确地研究超大质量黑洞M87*和Sgr A*的光子环，以获取其自转和倾角的约束信息。

Method: 提出了一种新的干涉可观测量，该量可在BHEX基线上直接测量，并且具有明确的图像域解释，即光子环的亮度分布。对该可观测量在多种半解析等倾发射模型中的表现进行了分析。

Result: 发现光子环的方位强度分布会根据源的天体物理特性而变化，但其宽度wb对这些细节的敏感度较低，类似于已知的环形状，可作为时空几何的探针。数值模拟支持了这一发现，表明通过光子环直径和wb可以对黑洞的自转和倾角进行约束。

Conclusion: BHEX有望实现基于光子环的高精度自转测量，为研究黑洞的时空几何和天体物理特性提供新的途径。

Abstract: The $n=1$ photon ring is a full image of the astrophysical source around a
black hole, produced by photons that execute $n\approx1$ half-orbit around the
event horizon on their way to an observer. The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is a
proposed extension of the Event Horizon Telescope to space that will target the
$n=1$ photon rings of the supermassive black holes M87${}^\ast$ and
Sgr\,A${}^\ast$. In this paper, we introduce a new interferometric observable
that will be directly measurable on BHEX baselines and which admits a clear
image-domain interpretation in terms of the photon ring brightness profile.
Across a wide range of semi-analytic equatorial emission models, we find that
the azimuthal intensity profile of the ring can change depending on the
astrophysics of the source, but its width $w_b$ is weakly sensitive to these
details -- much like the ring shape, which has previously been identified as a
probe of the spacetime geometry. Our survey suggests that interferometric
measurements of the photon ring diameter and $w_b$ can place constraints (to
$\lesssim\!20\%$) on the spin and inclination of a black hole with a known
mass-to-distance ratio, such as Sgr\,A${}^\ast$. State-of-the-art numerical
simulations support this finding, paving the way to a precise photon-ring-based
spin measurement for Sgr\,A${}^\ast$ with BHEX.

Conclusion: 磁场在TDEs早期阶段对湍流发电机的特性有显著影响，并可能影响后续的吸积盘辐射和喷流形成。

Abstract: Tidal disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes in galactic centers
(TDEs) are now being actively studied both theoretically and observationally.
They are observed throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to
gamma-rays. It is still unclear how the emission is produced and, in
particular, what is the role of the magnetic field of the disrupted star. There
are many ways how magnetic fields might affect the dynamics of a TDE. They are
likely responsible for the angular momentum transfer in the accretion disk
formed at later stages and thus affect the radiation associated with the disk.
Magnetic fields are also an important requirement for the formation of
relativistic jets, that are seen in some TDEs. The goal of our study is to
connect the field within the star to the fields that develop during the
fallback and disk accretion. Using the fluid-dynamic code Athena++, we perform
a large-scale three-dimensional adaptive-mesh magnetohydrodynamic simulation of
a tidal disruption of a magnetized star. The fallback stream returning to the
black-hole vicinity after the disruption contains smooth magnetic fields
aligned with the stream lines. Formation of a nozzle shock near the pericenter
of the initial orbit leads to a turbulent eccentric disk-like structure where
the field is amplified and entangled on the local dynamic time scales up to
approximate equipartition. The resulting field is mildly anisotropic and has a
typical length several times smaller than the pericenter distance. The
properties of the field are consistent with the early stages of turbulent
dynamo.

Abstract: The active galactic nucleus (AGN) accretion disks are ideal sites for
hierarchical black hole (BH) mergers. To robustly probe such a possibility, we
analyze binary black hole mergers in the GWTC-4 with a flexible mixture
population model for component masses, spin magnitudes, and spin tilt angles,
and identify two distinct subpopulations. In the second subpopulation
characterized by high spin magnitudes $\chi\sim 0.8$ as well as the broad mass
distribution up to $\gtrsim 150M_\odot$, we find a pronounced preference for
spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum: an isotropic tilt distribution
is strongly disfavored (logarithmic Bayes factor = 4.5). The aligned events
account for $\sim 0.57^{+0.23}_{-0.31}$ of the second subpopulation,
corresponding to a local rate of $\sim 0.25^{+0.38}_{-0.16} ~ {\rm Gpc}^{-3}
{\rm yr}^{-1}$ (all values reflect central 90\% credible intervals). These
notable features naturally arise from hierarchical mergers embedded in AGN
disks, where gas torques can effectively align spins. Our results identify
AGN-disk hierarchical assembly as an important channel in the present
gravitational-wave sample and provide concrete, testable predictions for future
detection.

Abstract: The excess of muons observed in ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray air showers
relative to simulation predictions, known as the muon puzzle, provides indirect
evidence of our incomplete understanding of high-energy hadronic interactions.
An unambiguous resolution requires that each proposed solution be directly
tested through collider experiments probing hadronic interactions. In this
work, we develop a framework to assess the strangeness enhancement scenario,
wherein an increased yield of kaons relative to pions boosts muon production.
Using the MCEQ air-shower simulation package, we first identify the key
phase-space regions of hadronic interactions that drive muon yields in this
scenario. We then demonstrate that combining Pierre Auger Observatory muon
measurements with forthcoming kaon-to-pion ratio data from LHC Run~3 can
robustly constrain the scenario's parameters. In particular, we find that
achieving 10.8% precision on the kaon-to-pion ratio at LHCb and 8.4% at FASER
is sufficient to test the strangeness enhancement hypothesis over its viable
parameter space. These upcoming experimental results will provide the first
direct constraints on strangeness enhancement as a potential resolution of the
muon puzzle.

Abstract: We study the analysis method to determine the cosmic-ray energy spectra of
different mass groups assuming the use of the Tibet AS$\gamma$ experiment,
which consists of the high-density Tibet air-shower array (Tibet-AS) and the
underground muon detector (MD) array. These arrays measure the sampling air
shower size $\Sigma\rho$ and the total muon number $\Sigma N_{\mu}$ of each air
shower event. These parameters are known to contain information on the energy
and mass of the primary particle. To reconstruct the energy spectra of
individual cosmic-ray mass groups, we apply a multidimensional unfolding method
based on Bayes' theorem to the two-dimensional distribution of $\Sigma\rho$ and
$\Sigma N_{\mu}$ produced by Monte Carlo simulation. Simulated datasets with
combinations of the EPOS-LHC, SIBYLL-2.3c, and QGSJET~II-04 high-energy
hadronic interaction models and a helium-dominant composition model are
analyzed while using a response matrix produced by EPOS-LHC. The unfolded
spectra of the EPOS + helium-dominant composition model dataset show a
deviation from the input flux within $\pm$10\% except for a few bins, meaning
that the uncertainty of the technique itself and the composition model
dependence is at that level. It is also shown that the deviation in the
all-particle spectrum is within $\pm$10\% even when using different hadronic
interaction models in the dataset and the response matrix. On the other hand,
the unfolded spectra of individual mass groups have a clear dependence on the
hadronic interaction model. The model dependence of the proton and helium
spectra amounts to \pm25% below 10$^{6.5}$ GeV. The dependence in the carbon
group is at a \pm25% level below 10$^{6}$ GeV, and for the iron spectrum, it
amounts to +55% and -30% in the energy range of 10$^{5.1}$ GeV to 10$^{6.7}$
GeV.

Abstract: The ASTRI Mini-Array consists of nine Cherenkov telescopes under construction
at the Observatorio del Teide, with one of them already performing observations
since November 2024. Given the complexity of the analysis of gamma-ray data
acquired with Cherenkov telescopes, a proper evaluation of the quality of these
data is important to avoid a negative impact on the high-level scientific
products. There are several factors that can contribute to reducing the quality
of the observations, such as clouds, high humidity or a high dust concentration
in the air, among others. In order to take all these factors into account and
evaluate their impact on the data, a quality check pipeline has been developed
for ASTRI. This contribution describes the pipeline, from its inputs at
different data levels to the production of outputs in the form of good-quality
lists and diagnostic plots. We also show how setting preliminary quality cuts
on the Crab Nebula data taken with the first ASTRI telescope can significantly
improve the source detection.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate from explosions at cosmological distances,
generating collimated jets. GRB 221009A, exploded on 9 October 2022, has been
established as the brightest GRB to date. Its bright and long emission was
extensively followed up from radio to gamma rays. LHAASO firmly detected the
onset of the afterglow emission at energies up to $\sim$13 TeV within about an
hour after the burst, starting just a few minutes after the trigger. While this
VHE emission component can be accounted for in a narrow jet scenario, such an
interpretation cannot reproduce the broadband emission observed at later times,
which exceeds the theoretical expectations. This discrepancy can be settled if
more complex models are considered, providing the first strong evidence for a
structured jet in a long GRB. Unfortunately, the VHE emission after a few hours
is poorly constrained, as sensitive VHE observations by Cherenkov Telescopes
were prevented due to strong moonlight conditions. The first Large-Sized
Telescope (LST-1) of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory began
observations about one day after the burst under high night sky background
conditions. These observations are the first ones performed on GRB 221009A by a
Cherenkov telescope, revealing a hint of a signal with a statistical
significance of about 4$\sigma$ during the observations performed at 1.3 days
after the burst. The monitoring campaign continued until the end of November
2022, making it the deepest observation campaign performed on a GRB with the
LST-1. In this contribution, we will present the analysis results of the LST-1
observation campaign on GRB 221009A in October 2022.

Conclusion: CTLearn在CTAO数据处理中表现出色，为未来的数据分析提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is the next-generation
ground-based observatory for very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray astronomy. The
Large-Sized Telescope prototype, LST-1, located on the Canary Island of La
Palma, is responsible for observation of the low-energy range of the VHE
gamma-ray spectrum. It is undergoing commissioning and has already observed the
Crab Nebula as a standard reference source. Accurate reconstruction of shower
parameters (e.g. energy, direction, and particle type) is crucial for achieving
the scientific goals of the CTAO. In this work, we use CTLearn to implement
deep-learning event reconstruction, as an alternative to the standard Random
Forest method. CTLearn is built to be fully compatible with ctapipe, a
framework for prototyping the low-level data processing algorithms for the
CTAO, and can be seamlessly used for data analysis without changing the general
framework. It implements convolution-neural-network based models that take the
integrated charge and the relative peak time of calibrated pixels in cleaned
images as an input, to infer the primary particle's properties. Using Crab
Nebula observations as a validation sample, we explore two different
approaches. The first is to train a model with Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations
covering all possible altitude-azimuth coordinates of the Crab Nebula sample
observations, resulting in a single model that can be used to reconstruct
events from any Crab Nebula observations. The second approach is to train 10
models along this coordinate line, each incorporating a range of
\textasciitilde10{\deg} in altitude. In this contribution, we present our
investigation of the performance of CTLearn models, and highlight the potential
of CTLearn for future data analysis in the CTAO.

Abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will be the next-generation
major ground-based gamma-ray observatory. It will be made up of two large
arrays of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), with one site in
the Northern hemisphere (La Palma, Canary Islands) and one in the Southern
(Paranal, Chile). CTAO aims to offer great improvement in energetic and angular
resolution with respect to current IACT systems, spanning a photon energy range
from 20 GeV to 300 TeV, as well as a significantly larger effective area and
full-sky coverage. Besides a percentage of observational time available for
external proposals, making it the first open gamma-ray observatory, the core
observational program of CTAO is organized in several Key Science Projects. A
significant amount of time will be devoted to dark matter (e.g. WIMPs,
axion-like particles) and fundamental physics studies from a variety of
targets, including the Milky Way's Galactic centre, dwarf spheroidal galaxies,
the Large Magellanic Cloud, and extragalactic objects such as blazars. In this
contribution, an overview of CTAO's main features is provided, with a focus on
its capabilities to investigate these yet unanswered questions of modern
physics.

Conclusion: 机器学习分类器在检测ALPs与光子的转换现象上提供了一个有效的替代方法，有望提高CTAO的探测能力。

Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are a common prediction of several extensions of
the Standard Model of particle physics and could be detected through their
coupling to photons, which enables ALP-photon conversions in external magnetic
fields. This conversion could lead to two distinct signatures in gamma-ray
spectra of blazars: a superimposition of energy-dependent "wiggles" on the
spectral shape, and a hardening at high (multi-TeV) energies, due to the ALP
beam eluding absorption by the extragalactic background light (EBL). The
enhanced energy resolution of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO)
with respect to present ground-based gamma-ray telescopes makes it an ideal
instrument to probe such phenomena. In this contribution, we explore a
different approach based on the use of machine learning (ML) classifiers and
compare it to the standard method. Our preliminary results suggest that both
techniques yield consistent results, with the ML-based method offering
comparable or even slightly broader coverage, potentially extending the CTAO
sensitivity beyond existing constraints.

Motivation: 研究者希望通过分析M87*在不同时间点的偏振图像，验证EHT成像的可靠性，并探索视界尺度上的物质流动和磁场结构的动态变化。

Method: 研究团队使用了2017、2018和2021年的EHT数据，其中2021年的观测通过新增的Kitt Peak望远镜和NOEMA阵列显著提升了基线覆盖范围。通过对比不同年份的偏振图像，研究了总强度与线性偏振的变化。

Result: 2017、2018和2021年的观测结果显示，总强度和线性偏振在年份间有显著变化。总强度的方位亮度分布每年不同，而2018和2021年的偏振分数峰值约为5%，低于2017年的约15%。2021年观察到的电矢量位置角螺旋模式变化，可能反映磁化吸积流或外部法拉第屏幕的变化。

Conclusion: 这些观测结果验证了EHT图像的可靠性，并揭示了M87*视界尺度周围吸积流的动态特性，包括磁场结构的变化，为研究黑洞周围物理过程提供了新的证据。

Abstract: We report three epochs of polarized images of M87* at 230\,GHz using data
from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) taken in 2017, 2018, and 2021. The
baseline coverage of the 2021 observations is significantly improved through
the addition of two new EHT stations: the 12\,m Kitt Peak Telescope and the
Northern Extended Millimetre Array (NOEMA). All observations result in images
dominated by a bright, asymmetric ring with a persistent diameter of $43.9\pm
0.6\,\muas$, consistent with expectations for lensed synchrotron emission
encircling the apparent shadow of a supermassive black hole. We find that the
total intensity and linear polarization of \m87 vary significantly across the
three epochs. Specifically, the azimuthal brightness distribution of the total
intensity images varies from year to year, as expected for a stochastic
accretion flow. However, despite a gamma-ray flare erupting in M87
quasi-contemporaneously to the 2018 observations, the 2018 and 2021 images look
remarkably similar. The resolved linear polarization fractions in 2018 and 2021
peak at $\sim$5\%, compared to $\sim$15\% in 2017. The spiral polarization
pattern on the ring also varies from year to year, including a change in the
electric vector position angle helicity in 2021 that could reflect changes in
the magnetized accretion flow or an external Faraday screen. The improved 2021
coverage also provides the first EHT constraints on jet emission outside the
ring, on scales of $\lesssim 1$\,mas. Overall, these observations provide
strong proof of the reliability of the EHT images and probe the dynamic
properties of the horizon-scale accretion flow surrounding \m87.

Abstract: The EXTraS project, based on data collected with the XMM-Newton observatory,
provided us with a vast amount of light curves for X-ray sources. For each
light curve, EXTraS also provided us with a set of features
(https://extras.inaf.it). We extract from the EXTraS database a tabular dataset
of 31,832 variable sources by 108 features. Of these, 13,851 sources were
manually labeled as stellar flares or non-flares based on direct visual
inspection. We employ a supervised learning approach to produce a catalog of
stellar flares based on our dataset, releasing it to the community. We leverage
explainable AI tools and interpretable features to better understand our
classifier. We train a gradient boosting classifier on 80\% of the data for
which labels are available. We compute permutation feature importance scores,
visualize feature space using UMAP, and analyze some false positive and false
negative data points with the help of Shapley additive explanations -- an AI
explainability technique used to measure the importance of each feature in
determining the classifier's prediction for each instance. On the test set made
up of the remainder 20\% of our labeled data, we obtain an accuracy of 97.1\%,
with a precision of 82.4\% and a recall of 73.3\%. Our classifier outperforms a
simple criterion based on fitting the light curve with a flare template and
significantly surpasses a gradient-boosted classifier trained only on
model-independent features. False positives appear related to flaring light
curves that are not associated with a stellar counterpart, while false
negatives often correspond to multiple flares or otherwise peculiar or noisy
curves. We apply our trained classifier to currently unlabeled sources,
releasing the largest catalog of X-ray stellar flares to date. [abridged]

Abstract: Cen X-3 is a bright, high-mass X-ray binary pulsar. We present a pulse
phase-resolved X-ray spectral analysis of data from an archival XMM-Newton
observation of Cen X-3 taken during the high state of the source. The
observation was entirely in the out-of-eclipse part of the binary orbit. We
study the pulse phase variability of the three K${\alpha}$ fluorescent emission
lines from near-neutral, Helium-like and Hydrogen-like iron, along with the
iron K${\beta}$ emission line. All four lines show clear modulation with the
pulse phase of the neutron star, and modulation is found to be higher for the
lines from highly ionised iron compared to the neutral lines. Structures within
the light travel distance corresponding to the pulse period of the neutron star
are likely responsible for the pulse phase modulation of the emission lines. We
have also investigated the orbital phase dependence of the pulse phase
variability in the iron lines by dividing the data into four segments at
different orbital phases of Cen X-3. The pulse phase modulation behaviour of
the four lines is quite identical at different orbital phases of Cen X-3,
indicating the pulsed iron emission region is persistent in nature and probably
phase aligned with respect to the observer. The accretion stream intercepting
the line of sight can probably produce the observed phase dependence of the
iron fluorescence emission lines.
