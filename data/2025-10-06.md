TL;DR: 该研究通过分析NICER和AstroSat数据，探讨了中子星低质量X射线双星系统SAX J1808.4-3658在2022年爆发期间的吸积过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解中子星低质量X射线双星系统中的吸积组分有助于揭示吸积机制的基本方面和系统演化的物理特性。

Method: 采用光谱和非周期性定时分析方法，利用NICER和AstroSat的观测数据，研究SAX J1808.4-3658在爆发期间的辐射特性。

Result: 发现软吸积盘和硬的中心位置的准直型康普顿化日冕解释了整个爆发期间源的连续谱。吸积盘内边缘温度、日冕电子温度和光子指数分别约为0.5-0.9 keV、几keV和1.1-1.8。检测到两个宽带非周期性特征（~0.004-2 Hz；~10-100 Hz），前者在1.5-10.0 keV和0.5-1.5 keV光子之间有显著的硬滞后约11毫秒。

Conclusion: 结论是，吸积盘光子和日冕散射的光子分别对低频和高频非周期性特征作出更大贡献。

Abstract: Understanding accretion components in neutron star (NS) low mass X-ray binary
(LMXB) systems is important to probe fundamental aspects of accretion mechanism
and evolution of the system constraining its physical properties. Here, we
present spectral and aperiodic timing analyses of the NICER and AstroSat data
from the accretion powered millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP) SAX J1808.4-3658
during its 2022 outburst. We find that emissions from a softer accretion disk
and a harder, centrally located, compact, partially covering, Comptonizing
corona explains the continuum spectra from the source throughout the outburst.
The disk inner edge temperature, the coronal electron temperature and photon
index are found to be around ~ 0.5-0.9 keV, a few keV and ~ 1.1-1.8,
respectively, during the entire outburst. We also find an intrinsic atomic
hydrogen medium in the system, which substantially and systematically evolved
throughout the outburst. We detect two broadband aperiodic features (~ 0.004-2
Hz; ~ 10-100 Hz), with the former having a significant hard lag of ~ 11 ms
between 1.5-10.0 keV and 0.5-1.5 keV photons. We conclude that both the disk
photons and the photons up-scattered by the corona contributed to each
aperiodic feature, with the disk and the corona contributing more to the low
and high frequency ones, respectively.

Abstract: We characterize the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) pulsar SXP 46.6 using NuSTAR
observations conducted in 2017. The spin period (P) of this neutron star
decreased from its discovered value of 46.6 s to a value of 45.984(1) s,
indicating a spin-up at the rate of \dot{P} = -1.13 x 10^{-9} s s^{-1}. This
spin-up rate is used to calculate a high pulsar magnetic field value of 2.25 x
10^{13} G. This process also gives a low magnetic field value, which we rule
out here by constraining the inner accretion disk radius to be less than the
radius of the innermost stable circular orbit. The pulse profile, analyzed in
soft, hard, and broad X-ray bands, shows a double-peaked structure, consistent
with pencil beam emission from two antipodal hot spots on the neutron star
surface. We also perform spin phase-resolved spectroscopy for the first time,
revealing spectral variations across different phases of the pulsar's rotation.
These results offer new insights into the long-term spin evolution and emission
properties of SXP 46.6.

TL;DR: This paper presents comprehensive follow-up observations of the black hole X-ray binary GX 339-4 during its 2023/24 outburst, focusing on mid-infrared (MIR) data from JWST/MIRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the growth of accreting black holes requires sensitive multiwavelength observations, particularly in the MIR regime which has been poorly explored except for jet-dominant states.

Method: The authors conducted a multi-wavelength campaign coordinated with JWST/MIRI observations, analyzing the X-ray properties and MIR spectrum of GX 339-4 in a disc-dominated state.

Result: The MIR spectrum shows a power-law slope of +0.39$ackslash$pm$0.07, significantly different from radio/sub-mm and optical broadband slopes. MIR luminosities are high across all accretion states, and there is stochastic variability and a long MIR lag relative to optical.

Conclusion: Synchrotron radiation from the high-energy Comptonisation medium accounts for the observed MIRI spectral-timing behavior, providing new constraints on the soft-state accretion disc atmosphere/corona. Alternative explanations like circumbinary disc or warm wind do not fit as well.

Abstract: Progress in understanding the growth of accreting black holes remains
hampered by a lack of sensitive coordinated multiwavelength observations. In
particular, the mid-infrared (MIR) regime remains ill-explored except for
jet-dominant states. Here, we present comprehensive follow-up of the black hole
X-ray binary GX 339-4 during a disc-dominated state in its 2023/24 outburst as
part of a multi-wavelength campaign coordinated around JWST/MIRI. The X-ray
properties are fairly typical of soft accretion states, with a high-energy
Comptonised tail. The source is significantly detected between 5-10$\mu$m,
albeit at a faint flux level requiring MIR compact jet emission to be quenched
by a factor of $\sim$300 or more relative to previous hard-state detections.
The MIRI spectrum can be described as a simple power-law with slope $\alpha$ =
+0.39$\pm$0.07 ($F_\nu$ $\propto$ $\nu^\alpha$), but surprisingly matches
neither the radio/sub-mm nor the optical broadband slopes. Significant MIR
stochastic variability is detected. Synchrotron radiation from the same medium
responsible for high-energy Comptonisation can self-consistently account for
the observed MIRI spectral-timing behaviour, offering new constraints on the
physical conditions in the soft-state accretion disc atmosphere/corona.
Alternative explanations, including a circumbinary disc or emission from a warm
wind, fail to cleanly explain either the spectral properties or the
variability. Multiwavelength timing cross-correlations show a puzzlingly long
MIR lag relative to the optical, though at limited significance. We compile
archival MIR and X-ray luminosities of transient black hole systems, including
previously unreported detections of GX 339-4. These trace the evolution of the
MIR-to-X-ray flux ratio with accretion state, and also reveal high MIR
luminosities for GX 339-4 across all states. (abridged)

TL;DR: 该研究检测到G172.8+1.5附近高能伽马射线发射，该区域被认为是超新星遗迹（SNR）或电离氢区（H II区）。利用16年Pass 8数据，发现两个具有不同光子谱的扩展源，可能的起源包括逃逸的宇宙射线、年轻星团和脉冲星晕。

Motivation: 研究G172.8+1.5附近高能伽马射线发射的起源，以确定其是超新星遗迹还是电离氢区，并探讨其与周围天体物理过程的关系。

Method: 使用Fermi-LAT的16年Pass 8数据，检测到两个扩展伽马射线源，并分析其光子谱和空间分布。

Result: 发现两个伽马射线源SrcA和SrcB，SrcA与中性氢壳结构和OB星相关，SrcB与恒星形成区相关，周围有致密分子云。SrcB区域的扩散系数显著低于SrcA。

Conclusion: 高能伽马射线发射的可能起源包括逃逸的宇宙射线、年轻星团和脉冲星晕，扩散系数的差异可能与宇宙射线驱动的不稳定性有关，未来LHAASO观测可进一步明确起源。

Abstract: We report the detection of high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission in the vicinity
of G172.8+1.5, which is debated as a Supernova remnant (SNR) or an ionized
hydrogen (H$_{\rm{II}}$) region. Using 16-yr Pass 8 data from Fermi Large Area
Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we found the GeV emission can be described by two
extended sources with different photon spectra. Among them, the much more
extended $\gamma$-ray source SrcA with a Power-law spectrum is spatially
coincident with a giant neutral Hydrogen shell structure and several OB stars
inside a huge H$_{\rm{II}}$ region. The softer Log-Parabola spectra
$\gamma$-ray source SrcB is spatially coincident with a star-forming region
with several OB stars, maser sources and IR sources. Gas observation results
display a dense molecular cloud surrounding SrcB in the velocity range of
[-25,-5] km s$^{-1}$. The possible origins of $\gamma$-ray emission are
discussed, including CRs escaped from SNR shock surface and illuminated nearby
MC, the young massive star clusters associated with the star-forming region and
a pulsar halo generated by an invisible energetic pulsar inside the SNR.
Furthermore, under the hadronic scenario, the measured diffusion coefficient in
the compact SrcB region is significantly lower than that of the more extended
SrcA. This suppression is likely attributed to cosmic-ray-driven instabilities,
which reduce the diffusion efficiency in the vicinity of the source relative to
the standard conditions in the interstellar medium (ISM). Future advanced
analysis from LHAASO observation results would help distinguish the origins of
$\gamma$-ray emission in this region and clarify the nature of this source.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recently, LHAASO detected a gamma-ray emission extending beyond
$100\,\rm{TeV}$ from 4 sources associated to powerful microquasars. We propose
that such sources are the main Galactic PeVatrons and investigate their
contribution to the proton and gamma-ray fluxes by modeling their entire
population. We find that the presence of only $\sim10$ active powerful
microquasars in the Galaxy at any given time is sufficient to account for the
proton flux around the knee and to provide a very good explanation of
cosmic-ray and gamma-ray data in a self-consistent picture. The $10\,\rm{TeV}$
bump and the $300\,\rm{TeV}$ hardening in the cosmic-ray spectrum naturally
appear, and the diffuse background measured by LHAASO above a few tens of
$\rm{TeV}$ is accounted for. This supports the paradigm in which cosmic rays
around the knee are predominantly accelerated in a very limited number of
powerful microquasars.

Motivation: 为了更精确地约束射电耀变体喷流中的γ射线发射模型，需要确定γ射线发射区域的具体位置。

Method: 使用ALMA、OVRO、SMA和Fermi/LAT的射电和γ射线数据，研究γ射线与多频率射电光变曲线的交叉相关，并结合VLBA观测分析喷流运动学。

Result: 发现两个明亮且紧凑的新喷流成分，与γ射线和射电光变曲线的高活动期相关；喷流速度为β_app=19±10，观测角度上限为φ<4度；确定了幂律指数l=0.974±0.098、s=-3.31±0.31、k_r=1.09±0.17，符合等离子体喷流模型。

Conclusion: γ射线发射区域位于距喷流基部2.6-20 pc范围内，超出了BLR预期范围，挑战了依赖BLR逆康普顿散射的耀变体发射模型。

Abstract: The FSRQ 4C+01.28 is a bright and highly variable radio and $\gamma$-ray
emitter. We aim to pinpoint the location of the $\gamma$-ray emitting region
within its jet in order to derive strong constraints on $\gamma$-ray emission
models for blazar jets. We use radio and $\gamma$-ray data obtained with ALMA,
OVRO, SMA and Fermi/LAT to study the cross-correlation between $\gamma$-ray and
multi-frequency radio light curves. Moreover, we employ VLBA observations at 43
GHz over a period of around nine years to study the parsec-scale jet
kinematics. To pinpoint the location of the $\gamma$-ray emitting region, we
use a model in which outbursts shown in the $\gamma$-ray and radio light curves
are produced when moving jet components pass through the $\gamma$-ray emitting
and the radio core regions. We find two bright and compact newly ejected jet
components that are likely associated with a high activity period visible in
the $\gamma$-ray and radio light curves. The kinematic analysis of the VLBA
observations leads to a maximum apparent jet speed of $\beta_{app}=19\pm10$ and
an upper limit on the viewing angle of $\phi$ < 4 deg. We determine the power
law indices that are characterizing the jet geometry, brightness temperature
distribution, and core shift to be $l=0.974\pm0.098$, $s=-3.31\pm0.31$, and
$k_r=1.09\pm0.17$, which are in agreement with a conical jet in equipartition.
A cross-correlation analysis shows that the radio light curves follow the
$\gamma$-ray light curve. We pinpoint the location of the $\gamma$-ray emitting
region with respect to the jet base to the range of $2.6\,\mathrm{pc}\leq
d_\gamma\leq20\,\mathrm{pc}$. Our derived observational limits places the
location of $\gamma$-ray production in 4C+01.28 beyond the expected extent of
the broad-line region (BLR) and therefore challenges blazar-emission models
that rely on inverse Compton up-scattering of seed photons from the BLR.

Motivation: 核心坍缩超新星（CCSN）的爆炸机制尚未完全明确，而低频引力波（GW）的检测能够提供关于其内部过程的重要信息。因此，需要一种专门的框架来分析GW数据，以进一步约束这些机制。

Result: 研究结果显示，成功检测到核心坍缩超新星的低频分析能够有效约束其爆炸机制。同时，对SN 2019fcn的高频分析表明，即使信号在低频部分微弱，高频部分也能提高探测显著性。

Conclusion: 专门频率框架在探测核心坍缩超新星的低频信号时具备有效性，并可扩展至其他应用领域。高频分析在某些情况下能显著增强信号检测效果，从而验证框架的多功能性。

Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) emissions from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe)
provide insights into the internal processes leading up to their explosions.
Theory predicts that CCSN explosions are driven by hydrodynamical instabilities
like the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) or neutrino-driven
convection, and simulations show that these mechanisms emit GWs at low
frequencies ($\lesssim 0.25 \,{\rm kHz}$). Thus the detection of low-frequency
GWs, or lack thereof, is useful for constraining explosion mechanisms in CCSNe.
This paper introduces the dedicated-frequency framework, which is designed to
follow-up GW burst detections using bandpass analyses. The primary aim is to
study whether low-frequency (LF) follow-up analyses, limited to $\leq 256
\,{\rm Hz}$, constrain CCSN explosion models in practical observing scenarios.
The analysis dataset comprises waveforms from five CCSN models with different
strengths of low-frequency GW emissions induced by SASI and/or neutrino-driven
convection, injected into the Advanced LIGO data from the Third Observing Run
(O3). Eligible candidates for the LF follow-up must satisfy a benchmark
detection significance and are identified using the coherent WaveBurst (cWB)
algorithm. The LF follow-up analyses are performed using the BayesWave
algorithm. Both cWB and BayesWave make minimal assumptions about the signal's
morphology. The results suggest that the successful detection of a CCSN in the
LF follow-up analysis constrains its explosion mechanism. The
dedicated-frequency framework also has other applications. As a demonstration,
the loudest trigger from the SN 2019fcn supernova search is followed-up using a
high-frequency (HF) analysis, limited to $\geq 256 \,{\rm Hz}$. The trigger has
negligible power below $256 \, {\rm Hz}$, and the HF analysis successfully
enhances its detection significance.

Abstract: The TeV gamma-ray band is essential for probing the most extreme particle
acceleration processes in the Universe. The recent detections of gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) at these energies offer an incredible opportunity to investigate
the origins of such transient events in an unprecedented way. In this
presentation, we analyze the afterglows of these GRBs by modeling their
synchrotron and inverse Compton emission within an optimized relativistic
fireball framework. By comparing observational data with theoretical
predictions, we constrain key model parameters and track their temporal
evolution. The comparison of different TeV-detected GRBs reveals an intriguing
variety among them, potentially reflecting differences in the particle
acceleration processes that have to be very fast and able to accelerate to
large energies. We discuss how late-time afterglow observations of X-ray and
GeV-TeV emissions are crucial for providing diagnostics into the physics of
GRBs. At this scope, we also present the most updated results of the AGILE
telescope, which support our interpretation. Finally, we highlight theoretical
predictions for future TeV observations and their implications for
understanding these extreme cosmic explosions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: AGN jet structure and stability remain uncertain; recollimation shocks are
linked to morphology and variability, but the role of downstream instabilities
is still unclear. We aim to investigate how jet magnetization and other
physical parameters influence the development of instabilities beyond the first
recollimation shock. In particular, we focus on identifying the conditions
under which the centrifugal instability (CFI) is effective. We perform
high-resolution 2D and 3D simulations using the relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics code PLUTO. The jets are initialized with a conical
geometry and propagate into an ambient medium, and we follow by axisymmetric
simulations how they evolve towards a steady-state. In 2D we explore a range of
magnetizations (from 0 to 1), pressure contrasts, and inertia ratios to
characterize the formation and evolution of recollimation shocks. The results
are further evaluated using linear stability analysis to assess the growth and
suppression of CFI. Finally, we perform 3D simulations of unstable and stable
jets. We discuss how the different parameters of the axisymmetric steady
solutions influence the location and strength of recollimation. We find that,
even in moderately magnetized jets, $\sigma$=0.1, the CFI can still develop
under suitable local conditions and disrupt the jet structure. This instability
is governed by the jet radius, curvature, Lorentz factor, and magnetization,
and is not always predictable from injection conditions. While magnetization
can delay or locally suppress instability growth, it does not guarantee
long-term jet stability. Our 3D results highlight the limitations of 2D models
in capturing non-axisymmetric and nonlinear effects, and underline the complex
interplay between magnetic confinement and destabilizing mechanisms. These
findings have implications for interpreting variability, and polarization
structure in AGN jets.

Abstract: We present the optical and infrared properties of a sample of 24 radio
transient sources discovered in the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS).
Previous studies of their radio emission showed that these sources resemble
young gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) radio sources, but are less powerful and
characterized by low-power jets. The bursts of radio activity in most cases are
likely due to intrinsic changes in the accretion processes. However, for a few
sources in this sample, we cannot rule out the possibility that their radio
variability results from a tidal disruption event (TDE). In this work, we
extend our analysis to the optical and infrared regimes, confirming that our
sample of radio transients is not homogeneous in terms of their optical and
infrared properties either. The host galaxies of most of these sources are
massive ellipticals with emission dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN).
They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses typical of radio-loud
AGNs ($\rm >10^7\,M_{\odot}$), but exhibit very low accretion activity. In
contrast, the sources for which a TDE origin is suspected are either pure
star-forming galaxies or show significant ongoing star formation, similar to
radio-selected optically-detected TDEs. Additionally, two of them exhibit
infrared flares characteristic of TDEs, while the remaining sources do not
display significant variability outside the radio regime. Moreover, the
evolution of their radio brightness in the W3/radio diagnostic diagram, which
we employ in our analysis, also sets our TDE candidates apart from the rest of
the sample and resembles the radio variability seen in optically discovered
TDEs with radio emission. Finally, based on our findings, we hypothesize that
the mid-IR/radio relation can serve as a tool to distinguish between radio
transients caused by TDEs and those originating from intrinsic AGN variability.

Abstract: Recent observations from NICER in X-rays and LIGO/Virgo in gravitational
waves have provided critical constraints on the mass, radius, and tidal
deformability of neutron stars, imposing stringent limits on the equation of
state (EOS) and the behavior of ultra-dense matter. However, several key
parameters influencing the EOS, such as the maximum mass of neutron stars,
spin-down rates, and the potential role of exotic matter in their cores, remain
subject of ongoing debate. Here we present a new approach to constraining the
EOS by analyzing the X-ray afterglows of some short gamma-ray bursts, focusing
on "the internal plateau" phase and its abrupt decay, which reflect the
spin-down and possible collapse of a supra-massive neutron star into a black
hole. By linking critical neutron star masses with black hole formation
criteria and the observational data from Swift's BAT and XRT instruments with
compact object models, we explore three representative EOSs that range from
"soft" to "stiff". Our result supports a maximum mass for neutron stars of
approximately 2.39 solar masses at the threshold of black hole formation. This
conclusion holds under assumptions of magnetar-powered X-ray plateaus, constant
radiative efficiency, isotropic emission, and full Kerr black hole energy
extraction; deviations could influence the inferred results. Our results
demonstrate the critical role of neutron star/black hole physics in probing
dense nuclear matter and provide a novel framework for exploring extreme
astrophysical environments.

TL;DR: The paper studies a new Very Faint X-ray Transient (VFXT) detected by Swift-XRT near the Galactic center, analyzing its 2024 and 2025 outbursts to determine its nature as a neutron star low mass X-ray binary (NS-LMXB) with specific accretion flow properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the nature and accretion flow properties of a newly discovered VFXT, Swift J174610--290018, by characterizing its outbursts and spectral features.

Method: The authors used Swift-XRT light curves to determine outburst durations, XMM and NuSTAR data for X-ray spectral analysis, and Chandra and XMM observations from the last 25 years to assess the quiescent luminosity of the source.

Result: The 2024 outburst lasted about 50 days with L_X = 1.2e35 erg s^-1, while the 2025 outburst was shorter (5 days) with L_X = 9e34 erg s^-1. The spectral analysis revealed an excess at 6.5-7 keV, possibly from ionized Fe lines or a reflection component.

Conclusion: The analysis suggests that the source is a NS-LMXB, and the accretion disk corona model explains its low luminosity and peculiar iron lines.

Abstract: Very Faint X-ray Transients (VFXTs) are a class of X-ray binary systems that
exhibit occasional outbursts with peak X-ray luminosities (L_X< 1e36 erg s^-1)
much lower than typical X-ray transients. On 22nd February 2024, during its
daily Galactic center monitoring, Swift-XRT detected a VFXT, 7 arcmin from Sgr
A* dubbing it Swift J174610--290018. We aim to characterize the outburst that
occurred in 2024, and a second, distinct outburst in 2025, to understand the
nature and accretion flow properties of this new VFXT. Swift-XRT light curves
are used to constrain the duration of the two events. We carried out X-ray
spectral analysis exploiting XMM and NuSTAR data. We used Chandra and XMM
observations of the last 25 years to constrain the quiescent luminosity of the
source. During the 2024 outburst, which lasted about 50 days, the source
reached a luminosity in the 2-10 keV band of L_X = 1.2e35 erg s^-1 (assuming it
is located at the Galactic center). The 2025 outburst is shorter (about 5
days), and reached L_X = 9e34 erg s^-1. The spectral features of the source
include an excess at 6.5-7 keV, which can be associated either with a single
reflection line or with the ionized Fe XXV and XXVI lines. The same source was
identified in both the XMM and Chandra catalogs of point sources (known as 4XMM
J174610.7--290020). During previous detections, the source displayed luminosity
levels ranging from L_X= 2e32 to L_X = 3e34 erg s^-1 between 2000 and 2010.
Moreover, it exhibited a potential type I X-ray burst in 2004. The analysis of
the outbursts and the potential type I burst strongly suggests the neutron star
low mass X-ray binary (NS-LMXB) nature of the VFXT. The source can be described
by an accretion disk corona (as has been recently proposed by the XRISM/Xtend
analysis). This scenario explains the overall low luminosity of this transient
and the peculiar iron lines in the spectrum.

Abstract: The supernova remnant (SNR) S147 contains the pulsar PSR J0538+2817 and a
likely unbound binary companion, HD 37424. It is the only good Galactic
candidate for a binary unbound by a core-collapse supernova (SN). Using Gaia
DR3 parallaxes and photometry, we select the stars local to SNR S147 in a
cylinder with a projected radius of $100$ pc and a parallax range of $0.614 <
\varpi < 0.787$ mas (a length of $\simeq 360$ pc). We individually model the
most luminous of these stars. The two most luminous single stars are the
unbound binary companion, HD 37424, and HD 37367, with estimated masses of
$(13.51\pm0.05) M_{\odot}$ and $(14.30\pm0.09) M_{\odot}$, respectively. The
two most luminous binary systems are the spectroscopic binary HD 37366 and the
eclipsing binary ET Tau that have primary masses of $(20.9\pm0.12) M_{\odot}$
and $(16.7\pm0.09) M_{\odot}$, respectively. We model the Gaia color-magnitude
diagram (CMD) of this local stellar population using both single stars and a
model consisting of noninteracting binaries using Solar metallicity PARSEC
isochrones. For both models, the estimated age distributions of the $439$
$M_{G} < 0$ mag stars favor a high mass progenitor of
$21.5M_{\odot}-41.1M_{\odot}$ for the SN.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究发现，初始质量为12-40Mo的恒星模型在内核至少存在一个显著的强对流区，这有助于支持Jittering-Jets爆炸机制（JJEM）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究未充分探讨剥离包层的超新星前星体，该研究旨在填补这一空白，验证JJEM是否适用于这些类型。

Method: 利用一维恒星演化代码MESA，分析初始质量12-40Mo的模型，计算角动量参数j=rVconv，并观察内核的对流区特性。

Result: 所有模型在质量坐标达到中子星最大重力质量m=2.65Mo时，至少存在一个显著的对流区（j>2e15 cm²/s）。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持JJEM作为超新星爆炸的主要机制，并进一步强化了所有大质量恒星都会爆炸的结论。

Abstract: Using the one-dimensional stellar evolution code MESA, we find that all our
models in the initial mass range of 12-40 Mo, regardless of whether they have
hydrogen-rich, hydrogen-stripped, or helium+hydrogen-stripped envelopes, have
at least one significant strong convective zone in the inner core, which can
facilitate the jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We focus on
stripped-envelope CCSN progenitors that earlier studies of the JJEM did not
study, and examine the angular momentum parameter j=rVconv, where r is the
radius of the layer and Vconv is the convective velocity according to the
mixing length theory. In all models, there is at least one prominent convective
zone with j>2e15 cm^2/s inside the mass coordinate that is the maximum baryonic
mass of a neutron star (NS), m=2.65 Mo. According to the JJEM, convection in
these zones seeds instabilities above the newly born NS, leading to the
formation of intermittent accretion disks that launch pairs of jittering jets,
which in turn explode the star. Our finding is encouraging for the JJEM,
although it does not show that the intermittent accretion disks indeed form. We
strengthen the claim that, according to the JJEM, there are no failed CCSNe and
that all massive stars explode. In demonstrating the robust convection in the
inner core of stripped-envelope CCSN progenitors, we add to the establishment
of the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 一项针对三个已知中央致密天体（CCO）脉冲星的时序研究，发现其中两个表现出异常的时序扰动，可能与高内部温度、强埋藏磁场和超流体行为有关，或由持续的低级吸积引起。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究三个已知的CCO脉冲星的时序特性，以理解其独特的X射线辐射机制和物理性质，并探索可能的时序扰动原因。

Method: 利用Chandra、XMM-Newton和NICER观测数据，覆盖两个十年的时间跨度，分析脉冲星的自转减速率和时序残差，探讨其是否由 glitches 或极端时序噪声引起。

Result: 两个CCO脉冲星（1E 1207.4$-$5209 和 PSR J0821$-$4300）表现出非稳态自转减速，时序残差可通过glitches或极端时序噪声模型解释；第三个CCO脉冲星（PSR J1852+0400）因观测数据稀疏未能检测到类似效应。

Conclusion: CCO脉冲星的时序活动可能源于其与高能年轻脉冲星共有的物理特性，如高内部温度和强埋藏磁场，或是持续的低级吸积过程。研究结果拓展了对CCO脉冲星内部结构和演化机制的理解。

Abstract: We present a timing study of the three known central compact object (CCO)
pulsars, isolated cooling neutron stars in supernova remnants, using Chandra,
XMM-Newton and NICER observations spanning two decades. Relative to canonical
young pulsars, CCOs are spinning down at a very slow rate $|\dot f| <10^{-15}$
s$^{-2}$, implying a surface dipole magnetic field strength $B_s < 10^{11}$ G
that is too weak to account for their X-ray emitting hot spots. Two CCO pulsars
with sufficiently long monitoring, 1E 1207.4$-$5209 and PSR J0821$-$4300, are
seen to deviate from steady spin-down; their timing residuals can be modeled by
one or more glitches in $f$ and $\dot f$, or alternatively by extreme timing
noise. For the third CCO pulsar, PSR J1852+0400, the sparse temporal coverage
was insufficient to detect such effects. Glitch activity and timing noise in
large samples of rotation-powered pulsars correlate best with $\dot f$, while
the timing irregularities of the first two CCOs are extreme compared to pulsars
of the same $\dot f$. Nevertheless, timing activity in CCOs may arise from
properties that they share with other young but more energetic pulsars: high
internal temperature, strong buried magnetic field and superfluid behavior.
Alternatively, continuing low-level accretion of supernova debris is not ruled
out as a source of timing noise in CCOs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Supermassive black hole binary systems (SMBHBs) are thought to emit the
recently discovered nHz gravitational wave background; however, not a single
individual nHz source has been confirmed to date. Long-term radio-monitoring at
the Owens Valley Radio Observatory has revealed two potential SMBHB candidates:
blazars PKS 2131-021 and PKS J0805-0111. These sources show periodic flux
density variations across the electromagnetic spectrum, signaling the presence
of a good clock. To explain the emission, we propose a generalizable jet model,
where a mildly relativistic wind creates an outward-moving helical channel,
along which the ultra-relativistic jet propagates. The observed flux variation
from the jet is mostly due to aberration. The emission at lower frequency
arises at larger radius and its variation is consequently delayed, as observed.
Our model reproduces the main observable features of both sources and can be
applied to other sources as they are discovered. We make predictions for radio
polarization, direct imaging, and emission line variation, which can be tested
with forthcoming observations. Our results motivate future numerical
simulations of jetted SMBHB systems and have implications for the fueling,
structure, and evolution of blazar jets.
