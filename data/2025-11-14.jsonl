In this paper, we study the time-resolved signal expected from such early shocks. An internal collision is modeled using a 1D special relativistic hydrodynamical simulation and the photon distributions in the resulting forward and reverse shocks, as well as in the common downstream region, are followed to well above the photosphere using a designated RMS simulation code. The light curve and time resolved spectrum of the resulting single pulse is computed taking into account the emission at different optical depths and angles to the line-of-sight. For the specific case considered, we find a light curve consisting of a short pulse lasting $\\sim 0.1$ s for an assumed redshift of $z = 1$. The efficiency is large, with $\\approx 23$% of the total burst energy being radiated. The spectrum has a complex shape at very early times, after which it settles into a more generic shape with a smooth curvature below the peak energy, $E_p$, and a clear high-energy power law that cuts off at $\\sim 5$ MeV in the observer frame. The spectrum becomes narrower and softer at late times with $E_p$ steadily decreasing during the pulse decay from $E_p \\approx 250~$keV to $E_p \\approx 100$ keV. The low-energy index, $α$, decreases during the bright part of the pulse from $α\\approx -0.5$ to $α\\approx -1$, although the low-energy part is better fit with a broken power law when the signal-to-noise ratio is high. The high-energy power law is generated by the reverse shock at low optical depths ($τ< 30$) and has an index that decreases from $β\\approx -2$ to $β\\approx -2.4$. These results provide support for RMSs as potential candidates for the prompt emission in GRBs."}

In this work, we explore AI-driven symbolic regression (SR) frameworks to derive updated analytical relations for disk ejecta mass in binary neutron star mergers, trained on state-of-the-art numerical relativity simulations. Our method reveals a set of compact equations that outperform existing fitting formulae across multiple statistical metrics while remaining physically interpretable. Notably, SR also enables alternative predictor sets (e.g., $\\{M_1,M_2,\\tildeΛ\\}$) that match or exceed the accuracy of models relying solely on compactness of the lightest neutron star ($C_1$), enabling new parameter constraints from electromagnetic observations. Unlike traditional black-box machine learning models, these closed-form expressions generalize robustly to regions of the parameter space not represented in the training data, offering a physics-informed tool for multimessenger observations and constraints on the neutron star equation of state."}

In the context of the CTAO Science Collaboration, within the AGN Population working group, we developed a variability-based strategy to improve predictions of AGNs detectable by CTAO, using Fermi-LAT data and normalized excess variance (NXS) as a tracer of flux variability. By extrapolating from 30-day to 3-day timescales, we expanded the sample of sources with short-timescale variability estimates from 87 to 407. This approach allows us to identify flaring and distant AGNs that are promising CTAO targets. The results are being used to support the CTAO extragalactic science program and will be included in an upcoming Consortium publication for the AGN Population collaboration."}

In this work, we model MSP populations in intermediate-mass GCs using the direct $N$-body code \\textsc{NBODY6++GPU}. We update the code by implementing pulsar spin-down due to magnetic braking and spin-up through accretion, and use this framework to model the pulsar population in the globular cluster M71 to investigate the pulsar population within and the associated gravitational wave transients."}

This resonance locks the binary into a unique state where the neutron star spin evolves alongside the orbit. The resonance requires a finite neutron star ellipticity $ε$ possibly sourced by strong internal magnetic fields in magnetars, which are motivated by population study of eccentric neutron star-black hole binary GW200105. We find that the locking probability is proportional to $\\sqrtε$. We derive the phase correction in the gravitational waveform due to this resonance locking effect, and have conducted a search in all neutron star binaries up to the O4a gravitational-wave catalog, with no positive event found so far. Observations by next-generation detectors such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, or even the upcoming upgrade of Advanced LIGO, have the potential to detect such locking signals, enabling precise measurements of both neutron star's ellipticity and moment of inertia. Future searches should be performed to discover this resonance, or, if undetected, to place constraints on the magnetar fraction in neutron star binaries."}

Matches version for publication", "summary": "Arrays of precisely-timed millisecond pulsars are used to search for gravitational waves with periods of months to decades. Gravitational waves affect the path of radio pulses propagating from a pulsar to Earth, causing the arrival times of those pulses to deviate from expectations based on the physical characteristics of the pulsar system. By correlating these timing residuals in a pulsar timing array (PTA), one can search for a statistically isotropic background of gravitational waves by revealing evidence for a distinctive pattern predicted by General Relativity, known as the Hellings \\& Downs curve. On June 29 2023, five regional PTA collaborations announced the first evidence for GWs at light-year wavelengths, predicated on support for this correlation pattern with statistical significances ranging from $\\sim\\!2-4σ$. The amplitude and shape of the recovered GW spectrum has also allowed many investigations of the expected source characteristics, ranging from a cosmic population of supermassive binary black holes to numerous processes in the early Universe. In the future, we expect to resolve signals from individual binary systems of supermassive black holes, and probe fundamental assumptions about the background, including its polarization, anisotropy, Gaussianity, and stationarity, all of which will aid efforts to discriminate its origin. In tandem with new facilities like DSA-2000 and the SKA, fueling further observations by regional PTAs and the International Pulsar Timing Array, PTAs have extraordinary potential to be engines of nanohertz GW discovery."}

To investigate the underlying emission mechanisms, we performed a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis using multiwavelength data from \\textit{Swift}-XRT/UVOT and \\textit{Fermi}-LAT, covering the optical/UV to GeV $γ$-ray bands. The source shows strong energy-dependent variability, with the largest fractional variability in $γ$-rays, followed by X-rays and UV/optical, consistent with leptonic emission scenarios. Based on the variability patterns, we identified distinct flux states (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, VHE-FX1, and VHE-FX2). The X-ray spectra exhibit a clear ``harder-when-brighter'' trend across these states. We modeled the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using a one-zone model incorporating synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission, implemented in \\textsc{xspec} using $χ^{2}$ minimization. During the VHE detection, the corresponding X-ray/optical emission likely resembled the F2 state. Modeling the VHE SED using F1-state data led to an SSC overprediction of the VHE flux, whereas all other states were well described within the one-zone framework. Systematic trends in physical parameters are observed across flux states, including spectral hardening, increasing break energy, rising bulk Lorentz factor, and decreasing magnetic field with increasing flux. These results suggest that enhanced particle acceleration efficiency and stronger Doppler boosting drive the observed flaring activity, while the decrease in magnetic field indicates conversion of magnetic energy into particle kinetic energy, consistent with shock-driven scenarios."}

The growing sample of systems with highly unequal masses, such as GW190814 with $m_1=23.2\\,M_{\\odot}$ and $m_2=2.59\\,M_{\\odot}$ -- corresponding to a mass ratio $q=0.112$ -- cannot be readily explained by isolated binary evolution and may originate through dynamical assembly in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We investigate AGN discs capable of producing GW190814-like mergers using \\texttt{pAGN} to model self-consistent AGN torques, coupled with \\texttt{TSUNAMI}, a regularised N-body code including post-Newtonian terms up to 3.5 order. Suites of N-body simulations reveal possible outcomes of binary capture and merger, mean-motion resonance interactions, and other novel dynamical pathways. We develop analytical models linking the branching ratios of captures and mergers to local disc properties, applicable to black hole populations across all mass ratios. Capture probability is primarily governed by $\\mathscr{B}$, the ratio of libration time to resonance-width crossing, and is well-described by a log-Gaussian, $P(\\rm{capture}|\\mathscr{B}) = A \\exp[-(\\ln \\mathscr{B}-μ)^2/2σ^2]$, with $A = 0.41^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, $μ= 1.09^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$, $σ= 1.05^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$. This fit, while an upper limit, is useful for simplified population synthesis. Finally, we explore the mass ratio AGN luminosity parameter space and find that GW190814 may be formed in a low luminosity AGN of $L_{\\rm AGN}\\approx 10^{43.5}\\ \\rm erg\\ s^{-1}$. A more systematic parameter space exploration and future population studies will further test our predictions."}

To model the spectral energy distribution of these new sources, we apply the hybrid shock-turbulence acceleration framework previously developed for extreme high-frequency-peaked BL Lacs. We present three representative realizations that produce synchrotron peaks between $0.2$ and $2$ MeV and evaluate their multiwavelenght signatures. Our results show that UEHBLs would be undetectable with current GeV (Fermi) and future TeV (CTA) facilities due to severe Klein-Nishina suppression of inverse Compton scattering, but are ideal targets for proposed MeV missions such as COSI, AMEGO-X, and e-ASTROGAM. We further identify a sample of hard X-ray sources from the Swift-BAT catalogs that exhibit the expected spectral properties of UEHBLs, potentially representing the first observational hints of this population. If confirmed, UEHBLs would provide unique insight into particle acceleration in relativistic jets, imposing strong constraints on the maximum achievable electron energies. We also discuss the expected polarization and variability signatures, including the possibility of synchrotron-driven thermal instabilities leading to MeV flares. These findings underscore the critical importance of the MeV band for discovering and characterizing the most extreme accelerators among blazars."}
