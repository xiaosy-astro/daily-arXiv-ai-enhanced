However, several key\nparameters influencing the EOS, such as the maximum mass of neutron stars,\nspin-down rates, and the potential role of exotic matter in their cores, remain\nsubject of ongoing debate. Here we present a new approach to constraining the\nEOS by analyzing the X-ray afterglows of some short gamma-ray bursts, focusing\non \"the internal plateau\" phase and its abrupt decay, which reflect the\nspin-down and possible collapse of a supra-massive neutron star into a black\nhole. By linking critical neutron star masses with black hole formation\ncriteria and the observational data from Swift's BAT and XRT instruments with\ncompact object models, we explore three representative EOSs that range from\n\"soft\" to \"stiff\". Our result supports a maximum mass for neutron stars of\napproximately 2.39 solar masses at the threshold of black hole formation.

On 22nd February 2024, during its\ndaily Galactic center monitoring, Swift-XRT detected a VFXT, 7 arcmin from Sgr\nA* dubbing it Swift J174610--290018.

Swift-XRT light curves\nare used to constrain the duration of the two events. We carried out X-ray\nspectral analysis exploiting XMM and NuSTAR data. We used Chandra and XMM\nobservations of the last 25 years to constrain the quiescent luminosity of the\nsource.

Long-term radio-monitoring at\nthe Owens Valley Radio Observatory has revealed two potential SMBHB candidates:\nblazars PKS 2131-021 and PKS J0805-0111. These sources show periodic flux\ndensity variations across the electromagnetic spectrum, signaling the presence\nof a good clock. To explain the emission, we propose a generalizable jet model,\nwhere a mildly relativistic wind creates an outward-moving helical channel,\nalong which the ultra-relativistic jet propagates. The observed flux variation\nfrom the jet is mostly due to aberration. The emission at lower frequency\narises at larger radius and its variation is consequently delayed, as observed.\nOur model reproduces the main observable features of both sources and can be\napplied to other sources as they are discovered. We make predictions for radio\npolarization, direct imaging, and emission line variation, which can be tested\nwith forthcoming observations. Our results motivate future numerical\nsimulations of jetted SMBHB systems and have implications for the fueling,\nstructure, and evolution of blazar jets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
