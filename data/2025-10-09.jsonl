The GRB afterglow radiation\nprovides a powerful means to investigate the microphysics of relativistic\nshocks and to probe the medium surrounding the progenitor of the burst. In this\nstudy, we present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of 31 GRBs observed\nbetween 2008 and 2024 from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (X-ray Telescope\nand Burst Alert Telescope) and the Fermi Large Area Telescope, covering photon\nenergies from 0.3 keV to 300 GeV. Our goal is to characterize the broadband\nspectral properties of GRB afterglows in soft X-rays, hard X-rays, and\nhigh-energy gamma rays. We investigate correlations between spectral shape and\nenergy output across different parts of the spectrum. The observed emission is\nmodeled using a forward shock scenario that includes both synchrotron and\nsynchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation losses. The results favor an\nSSC-dominated radiation model in a wind-like medium, consistent with\nexpectations for long-duration GRBs. Crucially, this work provides new\nbenchmarks for the microphysical parameters governing the emission,\nparticularly indicating a notably low magnetic energy fraction, which refines\nprevious estimates. By modeling broadband data, this study offers one of the\nmost detailed SSC analyses in a wind-like environment to date. Notably, our\nresults naturally account for the comparable energy output observed in both the\nsoft X-ray and TeV bands, consistent with the previously detected TeV-GRBs."}

The correlation between the gamma-ray emission and the emission of the\nradio core allows us to characterize it starting from the luminosity function\nof the radio cores, which is modeled with greater accuracy due to the larger\nnumber of sources detected at these frequencies. We find that the diffuse\nemission as extrapolated from the properties of the subthreshold RGs is lower\nthan the one inferred from detected RGs, showing that the contribution of the\npopulation of RGs to the IGRB is lower than the previous estimates and it is\naround the 30% level of the IGRB intensity."}

Recent measurements reveal anisotropies in\narrival directions, a rigidity-dependent composition dominated by\nintermediate-mass nuclei, and striking hemispheric differences in the energy\nspectra. Here we show that rare transients in nearby galaxies can naturally\naccount for these features. In our fiducial neutron-star merger model, the\ncosmic ray flux above $25$ EeV is dominated by ten nearby galaxies within\n$8\\,$Mpc. This accounts for the observed hotspots: seven of the ten brightest\ngalaxies coincide with reported excess regions, a chance probability of\n$p\\simeq0.003$. Nearby transients also explain the spectral excess of TA over\nAuger; link their angular sizes to extragalactic magnetic fields at $\\sim$1 nG;\nexplain the dominance of individual species over narrow energy ranges; and the\nrigidity-aligned succession of isotopes."}
