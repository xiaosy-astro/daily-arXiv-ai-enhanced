Abstract: In the past decade, Swift has performed several AGN high-cadence
reverberation mapping campaigns, and generally found that the UV/optical
interband lags are $\sim$3 times longer than predicted for a standard thin
disk, thus coined "the accretion disk size problem". Here we present a
systematic sample of Swift-monitored AGN. In this analysis, we confirm the
accretion disk size problem, but find that the lag excess occurs only in the
subset of obscured AGN, which show a significantly elevated mean normalization
of $5.21 \pm 0.47$ ($p = 0.008$), whereas the unobscured AGN exhibit a mean
excess consistent with standard disk predictions ($1.00 \pm 0.31$). Correlation
and regression analyses similarly reveal X-ray column density as the strongest
predictor of lag excess, explaining over 80% of its variance. We interpret
these results as line-of-sight obscuration being linked to the too-long lags
via additional reprocessed emission from the absorbing material itself. The
consistency of lags in the unobscured subgroup with standard disk predictions
suggests that the accretion disk size problem is not the result of shortcomings
of standard accretion disk theory nor contamination by the broad-line region
(BLR). X-ray to UV lag amplitudes and correlations show more complex and
variable behavior in obscured AGN, suggesting that obscuration may disrupt or
complicate the connection between high- and low-energy emission potentially
through reprocessing, scattering, and/or ionization changes.

TL;DR: 研究利用三年的多波段监测数据，发现Fairall 9的UV和X射线光变之间存在非相干的随机波动，而非传统模型中的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 活动星系核（AGN）的吸积流结构尚不明确，因此需要通过多波段光变监测来探索其特性。

Method: 对Fairall 9进行了为期三年的大约每日多波段（光学/紫外线/X射线）监测，并运用傅里叶分析来检验随机模型。

Result: UV光变曲线在一年内出现了约50天的明显上升，与X射线光变曲线同步上升，但X射线波动与UV无显著相关性，并且在相位上领先。

Conclusion: X射线波动与UV波动之间的不相关性和相位领先表明，它们可能是由不同的随机机制引起的，光变时间延迟仅弱关联两者。

Abstract: The accretion flow in AGN is not well understood, motivating intensive
monitoring campaigns of multiwavelength variability to probe its structure. One
of the best of these is the 3 year optical/UV/X-ray approximately daily
monitoring campaign on Fairall\,9, a fairly typical moderate accretion rate
AGN. The UV lightcurve shows a clear increase over $\sim 50$ days between years
1 and 2, strongly coherent with the X-ray lightcurve rise. This changes the
average spectral energy distribution such that the disc component is stronger
while the X-ray spectrum steepens, so that the total X-ray power remains
roughly constant. Outside of this global change, we apply a Fourier resolved
analysis to test stochastic models where intrinsic fluctuations in the UV disc
propagate down into the hard X-ray emission region via both changing the seed
photon flux for Compton scattering (short light travel timescale) and changing
the electron density (longer propagation timescale). Unlike these models, the
hard X-rays are not particularly well correlated with the UV, and also have the
wrong sign in that the hard X-rays marginally lead the UV fluctuations. We show
that this is instead consistent with uncorrelated stochastic fluctuations in
both the UV (slow) and X-ray (fast), which are linked together only weakly via
light travel time. These variability properties, as well as the changes in the
SED, has implications for our understanding of AGN structure and physics, as
well as future monitoring campaigns.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Early light curves of many core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are thought to be
powered by the interaction of the shock wave with optically thick extended
material, either a bound envelope or preexplosion ejected circumstellar matter
(CSM). We analytically analyze the early emission produced by a shock with
velocity $v$ traversing a material of mass $M_\mathrm{e}$ and opacity $\kappa$
extending to radius $R_\mathrm{e}$, and show the emission varies qualitatively
with varying $\tau_\mathrm{e}=\kappa\!M_\mathrm{e}/(4\pi\!R_\mathrm{e}^2)$: For
$\tau_\mathrm{e}\gg\!c/v$ a shock breakout occurs near $R_\mathrm{e}$ producing
an ``edge breakout" -- a UV-dominated breakout burst followed by ``cooling
emission" of the shock-heated material; for $\tau_\mathrm{e}\lesssim\!c/v$ a
``wind breakout" occurs -- the breakout pulse is prolonged and followed by
extended emission shifting from UV to X-ray as the shock becomes collisionless.
We derive the dependence on $\{v,\kappa,M_\mathrm{e},R_\mathrm{e}\}$ of the
duration and luminosity characterizing the different emission phases, and show
that current observations typically do not allow inference of all parameters.
In particular, since the optical bands lie in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of
radiation emitted during the cooling phase, the observed cooling luminosity
depends weakly on radius, $\propto\!R_\mathrm{e}^{1/4}$, leading to $1-2$
orders of magnitude uncertainty in its inferred value. This suggests, e.g.,
that the common day-scale light curve features in Stripped-Envelope SNe do not
necessarily imply material extending to $R_\mathrm{e}\sim10^3\!R_\odot$ and are
often consistent with low-mass $R_\mathrm{e}\sim\!10^2\!R_\odot$ bound
envelopes. Early multiband coverage (especially in UV/X-ray) can break these
degeneracies; the forthcoming \emph{ULTRASAT} UV mission will allow inferring
the properties of extended material around the population of SNe progenitors.

Abstract: The distribution of binary black hole (BBH) masses and its evolution with
redshift provide key insights into the different formation channels of the
compact objects and their evolution with cosmic time and stellar properties
such stellar metallicity and star formation rate history. We present a non
parametric, model-independent joint reconstruction of the redshift evolution of
BBH mass distribution from gravitational wave (GW) catalog GWTC-4.0 from the
fourth observation of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). This method simultaneously
searches for the signature of any linear and quadratic redshift evolution with
respect to the low redshift in a Bayesian framework taking into accounting the
detector selection effects. We find tentative evidence for a linear
redshift-dependent evolution of the mass distribution, consistent over a mass
range ($m \gtrsim 50\,M_\odot$). While lower mass systems shows no signature of
evolution. The quadratic term remains consistent with zero, indicating that a
simple linear dependence adequately describes the population up to redshift $z
\sim 1$. In future with more GW sources, this technique can shed light into the
true nature of the redshift dependence and possibility to uncover subtle
evolutionary features in BBH populations and to probe the cosmic history of
black hole formation.

### [5] [VERITAS Follow-Up Observations of the Ultra-High-Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25422)
*Connor Mooney*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper presents the results of a gamma-ray follow-up study of the KM3-230213A ultra-high-energy neutrino event, exploring its potential extragalactic origin and implications for cosmic neutrino sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The detection of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A provides an opportunity to investigate the origins of cosmic neutrinos and their possible connection to gamma-ray counterparts, particularly in understanding whether the event has an extragalactic source or is transient in nature.

Method: VERITAS conducted targeted observations in 2025 using a four-point wobble strategy to cover the 90% confidence region of the neutrino's position, searching for very-high-energy gamma-ray emission.

Result: The study presents upper limits on very-high-energy gamma-ray flux and discusses their implications for the source models of KM3-230213A, suggesting that the event might not be cosmogenic and could have an extragalactic origin.

Conclusion: The lack of detected gamma-ray emission places constraints on the particle-acceleration models associated with the neutrino's origin, supporting the possibility that KM3-230213A has an extragalactic origin rather than being transient or cosmogenic.

Abstract: The recent announcement of the detection of the ultra-high-energy (UHE)
neutrino event KM3-230213A by the KM3NeT telescope represents a critical
opportunity to explore the origins of cosmic neutrinos and their potential
gamma-ray counterparts. With an inferred neutrino energy exceeding 100 PeV,
this event stands as the most energetic neutrino observed to date. The large
offset from the galactic plane (11 degrees) and the presence of several blazars
with temporally correlated multiwavelength counterparts within the 3 degrees
localization region raise the possibility of an extragalactic origin.
Additionally, the event's apparent tension with IceCube constraints suggests
that it could be transient in nature rather than cosmogenic. VERITAS conducted
a targeted follow-up campaign to search for very-high-energy (VHE, greater than
100 GeV) gamma-ray emission associated with KM3-230213A. Observations were
performed in February and March 2025, using a four-point wobble strategy
centered on the best-fit neutrino position, covering nearly the entire 90
percent confidence region. These observations probe potential hadronic
gamma-ray emission from a common origin with the neutrino, placing constraints
on particle-acceleration scenarios. We present the results of this search,
including upper limits on very-high-energy gamma-ray flux and their
implications for possible source models of KM3-230213A.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不同超新星类型的宿主环境及其延迟时间分布（DTDs）有助于揭示超新星的前身星系统和形成机制。钙丰富间隙瞬变现象（Ca-rich gap transients）及其宿主特性尚不清楚，因此需要进一步研究。

Method: 利用Zwicky瞬变设施（ZTF）局域宇宙普查（CLU）实验的数据，构建了包含四种超新星样本的数据库，并通过预计算的CLU目录中的宿主属性和通过SED拟合得到的属性来表征每个宿主的恒星质量、恒星形成率和特定恒星形成率（sSFR）。

Result: 钙丰富间隙瞬变和91bg类超新星的宿主星系在质量与sSFR参数空间中相似，且比Ia型和II型超新星的宿主星系更高质量和静止。此外，它们的延迟时间分布（DTDs）具有最长的峰值延迟时间，约为10^4 Myr，而Ia型超新星约为10^3 Myr，II型超新星约为10 Myr。

Conclusion: 钙丰富间隙瞬变和91bg类超新星的宿主环境及DTDs相似，这提示需要进一步分析这两种瞬变现象之间可能存在的联系，这可能对超新星的前身星系统和爆发机制有重要意义。

Abstract: Calcium-rich gap transients are a faint, fast-evolving class of supernovae
that show strong nebular Ca emission lines. Their progenitor systems are
uncertain, but they are often associated with old and quiescent host galaxies.
In this work, we compare the properties of the hosts of hydrogen-poor Ca-rich
gap transients to the hosts of 3 other classes of supernova (SNe): normal Type
Ia, 91bg-like, and Type II. We use data from the Zwicky Transient Facility
(ZTF) Census of the Local Universe (CLU) experiment to build up our 4 SNe
samples and identify the host galaxies. A combination of precomputed host
properties from the CLU catalog and those derived from SED fitting are used to
characterize each host's stellar mass, star formation rate, and specific star
formation rate (sSFR). We find that the hosts of Ca-rich gap transients and
91bg-like SNe occupy a similar parameter space of mass and sSFR, and are more
massive and quiescent compared to the hosts of Type Ia and Type II SNe.
Additionally, we construct delay time distributions (DTDs) for our 4 samples,
finding that Ca-rich gap transients and 91bg-like SNe have the longest peak
delay times $\sim 10^4$ Myr, compared to the peak delay times of Type Ia SNe
($\sim 10^3$ Myr) and Type II SNe ($\sim 10$ Myr). The similarity of host
environment and DTDs for Ca-rich gap transients and 91bg-like SNe motivates
further analysis of the relationship of these two transient classes.

Abstract: We present on results of a spatially resolved spectral analysis of G1.9+0.3,
the youngest known supernova remnant in the Galaxy. The X-ray spectra are well
described by synchrotron emission from a power-law electron distribution with
an exponential cutoff. We found a cutoff energy $\epsilon_0 \sim 1 ~ \rm{keV}$
in both the radio bright rim and the X-ray bright rims. In the loss-limited
case, the cutoff energy depends on the shock velocity $v_{\rm{sh}}$ and the
Bohm factor $\eta$, following the relation $\epsilon_0 \propto v_{\rm{sh}}^2
\eta^{-1} $. Our analysis shows that $\eta$ ranges from 2 to 4 in the radio rim
and from 12 to 15 in the X-ray rims. This suggests that the magnetic field in
the radio rim is more turbulent than in the X-ray rims. The presence of CO
clouds along the radio rim likely contributes to this difference. Interaction
between the shock and these clouds can slow the shock down and generate
turbulent eddies. The resulting turbulence eddies can amplify the magnetic
field. We propose that the strong radio emission from the radio rim is
primarily due to this amplified magnetic field. In contrast, a CO cloud located
in the south-west appears to lie in the foreground, as indicated by its low
turbulence and the absence of shock deceleration.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The possibility of neutron decay into dark particles has been proposed as a
way to resolve a growing discrepancy between two different measurements of the
neutron lifetime. The most popular formulation is a dark sector consisting of a
dark baryon $\chi$ and a dark scalar $\phi$, where a neutron in vacuum decays
about 1% of the time via the channel $n\rightarrow \chi+\phi$. In this work, we
consider the effect of this additional neutron decay channel on transport in
neutrons star mergers. We find that the neutron dark decay rate in medium is
quite slow, and thus the dark baryons modify the dense matter equation of state
in a way that decreases the Urca bulk viscosity by, at most, a factor of 2-3.
However, if the neutron dark decay was to occur more rapidly, then the bulk
viscosity at merger temperatures of tens of MeV would be strongly enhanced,
potentially rapidly damping oscillations in merger environments and therefore
providing a signature of slowly equilibrating matter in the merger.

Abstract: Stars captured by black holes (BHs) can be tore apart by strong tidal force,
producing electromagnetic flares. Some 100 tidal disruption events (TDEs) have
been observed, involving invariably normal gaseous stars whose debris falls
onto the BH fueling the flares over years. White dwarfs (WDs)-the most
prevalent compact stars a million times denser and thus tougher than gaseous
stars-can only be disrupted by intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of
10^2-10^5 solar masses. WD-TDEs are predicted to generate more powerful and
short-lived flares, but their evidence has been lacking. Here we report
observations of a fast, luminous X-ray transient EP250702a. Its one-day-long
peak showed strong recurrent flares extending to several tens of MeV in
gamma-rays, indicating relativistic jet emission. The jet X-rays dropped
sharply from exceeding 3 x 10^49 to around 10^44 erg/s within 20 days. These
characteristics are inconsistent with any known transient phenomena other than
a jetted-TDE evolving within a short timespan previously unseen-indicating the
disruption of a white dwarf by an IMBH. At late times, a new soft component
progressively dominates the X-ray spectrum, exhibiting extreme super-Eddington
luminosity, possibly from an accretion disc. WD-TDEs open a new window to study
elusive IMBHs and the otherwise invisible interior of degenerate stars.

Abstract: Galactic $\gamma$-ray sources can be produced by either high-energy protons
via proton-proton collisions or electrons/positrons via inverse Compton
scattering. Distinguishing between the hadronic and leptonic origin of
$\gamma$-ray emission in Galactic sources remains challenging. Measurements of
non-thermal X-ray spectra of these sources, which could originate from primary
electrons in the leptonic scenario or secondary electrons/positrons in the
hadronic scenario, have been suggested as an efficient way of discriminating
between these scenarios. In this work, we investigate the morphology of the
X-ray emission from secondary electrons/positrons. By calculating the surface
brightness profile and the photon index profile of X-ray emission, we find that
secondary electrons produce a distinctively flat X-ray surface brightness
profile. Our results suggest that, in addition to the X-ray spectrum, the X-ray
morphology is crucial to determine the radiation mechanism of ultrahigh-energy
$\gamma$-ray sources and help to identify sources of PeV cosmic rays.

Abstract: We consider a generalization of the classical nonrelativistic St\"{o}rmer
problem, describing the motion of charged particles in a purely magnetic dipole
field, by taking into account the effects of the dissipation, assumed to be of
friction type, proportional to the velocity of the particle, and of the
presence of stochastic forces. In the presence of dissipative/stochastic
effects, the motion of the particle in the magnetic dipole field can be
described by a generalized Langevin type equation, which generalizes the
standard Lorentz force equation. We perform a detailed numerical analysis of
the dynamical behavior of the particles in a magnetic dipolar field in the
presence of dissipative and stochastic forces, as well as of the
electromagnetic radiation patterns emitted during the motion. The effects of
the dissipation coefficient and of the stochastic force on the particle motion
and on the emitted electromagnetic power are investigated, and thus a full
description of the spectrum of the magnetic dipole type electromagnetic
radiation and of the physical properties of the motion is also obtained. The
power spectral density of the emitted electromagnetic power is also obtained
for each case, and, for all considered St\"{o}rmer type models, it shows the
presence of peaks in the radiation spectrum, corresponding to certain intervals
of the frequency.

Abstract: The search for gamma-ray counterparts to gravitational-wave events with the
CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) requires accurate and robust background
modeling. Previous CALET observing runs (O3 and O4) relied on averaged
pre/post-event baselines or low-order polynomial fits, approaches that neglect
correlated noise, temporal non-stationarity, and the propagation of background
uncertainty into derived flux upper limits. These simplifications can lead to
reduced sensitivity to faint or atypical transients. In this work, we present a
novel Bayesian framework for background estimation based on Gaussian Process
(GP) regression and change-point modeling. Our approach captures correlated
structures in the detector background, quantifies predictive uncertainties, and
propagates them into both detection statistics and Bayesian credible upper
limits. We demonstrate, using archival CALET time-tagged event data and
simulated signal injections, that our method improves sensitivity to weak
short-duration bursts by up to an order of magnitude compared to traditional
polynomial fits. This probabilistic background treatment enables a more
physically robust interpretation of non-detections and offers a scalable,
real-time compatible extension for future joint multi-messenger searches. All

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: It is generally believed that the electron-capture reactions happen when the
oxygen-neon (ONe) cores grow in masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit,
leading to the formation of neutron stars (NSs) via electron-capture supernovae
(EC-SNe). EC-SNe are predicted to be the most likely short-lived and faint
optical transients, and a small ejecta mass is expected during the collapse.
This kind of SNe provide an alternative channel for producing isolated NSs and
NS systems, especially for the formation of X-ray binaries and double NSs.
However, there are still some uncertainties for the origin of EC-SNe. In this
article, we review recent studies on the two classic progenitor channels of
EC-SNe, i.e., the single star channel and the binary star channel. In the
single star channel, EC-SNe can happen in super asymptotic giant branch stars
or He stars, whereas in the binary star channel EC-SNe can occur in He stars in
binaries (including He star+MS systems and NS+He star systems) or
accretion-induced collapse in white dwarf binaries (including the
single-degenerate scenario and the double-degenerate scenario). Recent progress
on the two progenitor channels is discussed, including the initial parameter
range for EC-SNe, the evolutionary paths to EC-SNe, related objects, and some
observational constraints, etc. We also discuss the formation of double NSs
through NS+He star binaries, in which the He star companion experiences an
EC-SN. Research on EC-SNe is at a pivotal stage, with key theoretical
uncertainties and observational challenges requiring integrated modeling and
multi-wavelength observations for robust identification.

TL;DR: CSS100217被提出为一个特殊的潮汐破坏事件（TDE）候选者，其光变曲线可通过受限于超大质量黑洞（SMBH）的尘埃遮蔽模型解释，表明遮蔽在解释其不寻常的TDE样变化中起重要作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一个遮蔽模型来解释CSS100217的异常光变曲线，不同于典型的TDE特性，即光变后亮度与光变前相近，而CSS100217的亮度在光变后降低了约0.4个星等。

Method: 假设由TDE未束缚的恒星残骸或核云围绕超大质量黑洞（SMBH）运动引起的时变遮蔽遵循威布尔分布，并通过拟合得出相关参数。

Result: 该模型表明，CSS100217的光变曲线可由4.6±0.9倍太阳质量的主序星被3.3×10^7±0.3倍太阳质量的黑洞潮汐破坏来描述，事件总能量为7.23×10^53 ergs，约1.38倍太阳质量的残骸被吸积。

Conclusion: 遮蔽可能在解释CSS100217的异常TDE样变化中起关键作用，这与光谱分析结果一致，表明宿主星系对光变前光学亮度的贡献不大。

Abstract: CSS100217 is considered a peculiar tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate
occurring in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Unlike typical TDEs, where the
post-flare luminosity is equal to that pre-flare, CSS100217 decayed to $\sim$
0.4 magnitudes fainter than its pre-flare V band level. In this manuscript, we
propose an obscured TDE model to explain the light curve of CSS100217. Assuming
that the time-dependent obscuration, caused by the TDE unbound stellar debris,
or by nuclear clouds moving around the supermassive black hole (SMBH), follows
a Weibull distribution, we find that the light curve of CSS100217 can be
described by the tidal disruption of a $4.6_{-0.9}^{+0.9}{\rm M_\odot}$
main-sequence star by a $3.3_{-0.3}^{+0.3}\times10^7{\rm M_\odot}$ black hole.
The total energy of the event derived from our fit is $7.23\times10^{53}$ ergs
and about 1.38 ${\rm M_\odot}$ of debris mass is accreted by the central SMBH.
The model indicates that the contribution of the host galaxy to the observed
pre-flare optical luminosity is not-significant compared to that of the AGN,
which is consistent with the results of the spectral analysis. These results
suggest that obscuration may play an important role in explaining the unusual

TL;DR: 该论文报告了通过MWA巡天在银河平面上发现的四个候选红背脉冲星，GPM J1723-33和GPM J1815-14位于Fermi 95%误差椭圆内。后续使用MeerKAT确认了GPM J1723-33的脉动，其他三个的未检测可能与伴星物质散射有关。所有源具有短轨道周期，可能与红背蜘蛛系统一致。多频段后续观测显示频率相关的日食，排除了某些散射机制。这些源可能与光学源相关，但需进一步使用大望远镜确认。此发现有助于理解银河中心未解释的伽马射线过剩现象。

Abstract: This paper reports the discovery and follow-up of four candidate redback
spider pulsars: GPM J1723-33, GPM J1734-28, GPM J1752-30 and GPM J1815-14,
discovered with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) from an imaging survey of
the Galactic Plane. These sources are considered to be redback candidates based
on their eclipsing variability, steep negative spectral indices, and potential
Fermi $\gamma$-ray associations, with GPM J1723-33 and GPM J1815-14 lying
within a Fermi 95% error ellipse. Follow-up pulsation searches with MeerKAT
confirmed pulsations from GPM J1723-33, while the non-detections of the other
three are likely due to scattering by material ablated from their companion
stars. We identify possible orbital periods by applying folding algorithms to
the light curves and determine that all sources have short orbital periods (<24
hours), consistent with redback spider systems. Following up on the sources at
multiple radio frequencies revealed that the sources exhibit
frequency-dependent eclipses, with longer eclipses observed at lower
frequencies. We place broad constraints on the eclipse medium, ruling out
induced Compton scattering and cyclotron absorption. Three sources are
spatially consistent with optical sources in the Dark Energy Camera Plane
Survey imaging, which may contain the optical counterparts. Each field is
affected by strong dust extinction, and follow-up with large telescopes is
needed to identify the true counterparts. Identifying potential radio
counterparts to four previously unassociated Fermi sources brings us closer to
understanding the origin of the unexplained $\gamma$-ray excess in the Galactic
Centre.

Abstract: We report on the search for ultra-high-energy neutrinos from the prompt
emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using Surface Detector (SD) data from Phase
I of the Pierre Auger Observatory (2004-2021). A total of 570 GRBs occur within
the most neutrino-sensitive field of view of the SD, considering both
Earth-skimming and downward-going detection channels. For this purpose, GRB
neutrino emission has been modeled using the numerical software NeuCosmA,
incorporating gamma-ray measurements and inferred parameters such as the jet
Lorentz factor and the minimum variability time scale. No neutrino candidates
were found, and upper limits were obtained by stacking the individual GRB
neutrino fluences. These limits are complementary to those of IceCube and
ANTARES and provide the strongest constraints on prompt GRB neutrino fluence
above $10^{18}$ eV. Additionally, limits on GRB fluence in alternative models
of neutrino production have been derived using Auger data.

Abstract: CTA~1 is a composite supernova remnant featuring a shell structure and an
inner Pulsar Wind Nebula. The shell is visible in the radio band, while Fermi
has detected the radio-quiet pulsar PSR J0007+7303 at its core. Gamma-ray
detectors such as LHAASO and VERITAS have detected TeV emission in the vicinity
of the pulsar. However, the derived SEDs from LHAASO WCDA and VERITAS show
significant discrepancies, which could be due to a complicated energy-dependent
morphology not accounted for in the spectral analysis, and different angular
resolution of the two experiments. CTA~1 has been a target for dedicated
observations by the SST-1M telescopes, a pair of small-sized Imaging
Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) capable of operating in both mono and
stereo modes. Located at the Ond\v{r}ejov Observatory in Czech Republic, these
telescopes are sensitive to the high energy range of the gamma-ray spectrum,
spanning from 1 to 300 TeV. To investigate the very high-energy emission of
CTA~1, the SST-1Ms have accumulated approximately 30 hours of selected
observations, aiming to further constrain the characteristics of the source's
high energy emission, and to shed some light into the discrepancy between
different experiments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We report an X-ray polarization degree (PD) of $8.8\pm1.4\%~(1\sigma)$ from
the accretion-disc-corona (ADC) neutron-star system 2S 0921-630 (=V395 Car)
observed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). The PD increases
with energy, while the polarization angle (PA) varies significantly across the
band. These trends are consistent with a high-inclination ADC geometry where
the vertically extended disc blocks direct sight of the central X-ray source,
and the observed X-rays are those scattered in an equatorial disc wind. We also
find tentative PD variability in the 2--3 keV band. To interpret the
time-averaged polarization, we build spectropolarimetric models by Monte Carlo
radiation transfer simulation with column density distribution of
thermal-radiative wind launched by X-ray irradiation of the outer disc under an
axisymmetric geometry. The model combines boundary-layer emission, its disc
reflection, and the disc continuum, each with its intrinsic polarization.
Scattering of this composite spectrum in the wind reproduces both the observed
PD and its increase with energy. However, the observed PA evolution is not
captured, which may indicate departures from axisymmetry--e.g. misalignment
between the inner disc (and/or neutron-star spin) and the outer disc/wind, or a
weak disc warping.

### [19] [Testing the nature of GW200105 by probing the frequency evolution of eccentricity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26152)
*Avinash Tiwari,Sajad A. Bhat,Md Arif Shaikh,Shasvath J. Kapadia*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: GW200105 is a CBC event with a neutron star and black hole, observed during O3. Recent reanalyses suggest eccentric orbit signatures, but the paper presents a model-independent test (EECT) confirming consistency with GR, supporting the eccentricity hypothesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about potential mimickers of eccentricity in CBC events, such as GW200105, caused by modified gravity or physical effects, the authors developed an Eccentricity Evolution Consistency Test (EECT) to verify if the eccentricity observed aligns with General Relativity predictions.

Method: The authors applied the EECT method to GW200105 by comparing the measured eccentricity evolution $ e(f) $ with that predicted by General Relativity. The test is model-independent, meaning it does not rely on specific waveform models.

Result: The analysis showed that GW200105 satisfies EECT within 68% confidence, indicating that the observed eccentricity is consistent with General Relativity predictions.

Conclusion: The study provides a new method for testing the consistency of eccentricity evolution with GR, supporting the eccentricity hypothesis while also highlighting the robustness of EECT in identifying true eccentric signals.

Abstract: GW200105 is a compact binary coalescence (CBC) event, consisting of a neutron
star and a black hole, observed in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's (LVK's) third observing
run (O3). Recent reanalyses of the event using state-of-the-art waveform models
have claimed observation of signatures of an eccentric orbit. It has
nevertheless been pointed out in the literature that certain physical or
modified gravity effects could mimic eccentricity by producing a spurious
non-zero eccentricity value, at a given reference frequency, when recovered
with an eccentric waveform model. We recently developed a model-independent
Eccentricity Evolution Consistency Test (EECT, S. A. Bhat et al. 2025) to
identify such mimickers, by comparing the measured frequency
$\textit{evolution}$ of eccentricity, $e(f)$, with that expected from General
Relativity (GR). In this $\textit{Letter}$, we apply EECT to GW200105 and find
that it satisfies EECT within 68% confidence. Our analysis therefore lends
complementary support in favour of the eccentricity hypothesis, while also
providing a novel test of the consistency of $e(f)$ with GR.

Motivation: 为了全面理解GRB 250702B/EP250702a的性质，作者结合多卫星数据进行深入分析。

Method: 使用ETJASMIN框架结合Insight-HXMT、GECAM和Fermi/GBM数据，对30天内的伽马射线爆发进行综合搜索。

Result: 在伽马射线带发现了主爆前25小时的50秒前兆，包含4次发射事件，主爆后的软X射线辐射符合幂律衰减，指数为-5/3，与经典的回落吸积预测一致。

Conclusion: 前兆、主暴及后续软X射线辐射的特性强烈支持非典型坍缩超长伽马射线暴（ULGRB）场景，而非潮汐剥离事件（TDE）模型。所有伽马射线和软X射线辐射可能源于相对论喷流，其亮度由超巨星死亡坍缩期间的回落吸积率主导。

Abstract: GRB 250702B/EP250702a is an interesting long-duration gamma-ray transient
whose nature is in debate. To obtain a full picture in gamma-ray band, we
implement a comprehensive targeted search of burst emission in a wide window of
30 days jointly with Insight-HXMT, GECAM and Fermi/GBM data within the ETJASMIN
framework. In gamma-ray band, we find there is a 50-second precursor about 25
hours before the 4-hour main burst, which generally consists of 4 emission
episodes. Remarkably, we find that the soft X-ray emission (after the main
burst) decays as a power-law with start time aligning with the last episode of
main emission and index of -5/3 perfectly consistent with the canonical
prediction of fallback accretion. We conclude that the properties of precursor,
main burst and the following soft X-ray emission strongly support the atypical
collapsar Ultra-Long Gamma-Ray Burst (ULGRB) scenario rather than the Tidal
Disruption Event (TDE), and all these gamma-ray and soft X-ray emission
probably originate from relativistic jet whose luminosity is dominated by the
fallback accretion rate during the death collapse of a supergiant star.

Abstract: The enigma of cosmic ray origin and propagation stands as a key question in
particle astrophysics. The precise spatial and spectral measurements of diffuse
Galactic gamma-ray emission provide new avenues for unraveling this mystery.
Based on 16 years of Fermi-LAT observations, we find that the diffuse gamma-ray
spectral shapes are nearly identical for low energies (below a few GeV) but
show significant dispersion at high energies (above a few GeV) across the
Galactic disk. We further show that the diffuse emission can be decomposed into
two components, a universal spectral component dominating at low energies which
is consistent with the expectation from interactions of background cosmic rays
and the interstellar matter, and a spatially variant component dominating at
high energies which is likely due to local accelerators. These findings suggest
that there is dual-origin of the Galactic diffuse emission, including the
``cosmic ray sea'' from efficient propagation of particles and the ``cosmic ray
islands'' from inefficient propagation of particles, and thus shed new light on
the understanding of the propagation models of Galactic cosmic rays.

Abstract: Dense neutrino systems, which display collectivity mediated by the weak

other fundamental forces. We identify analogues in fast flavor conversion (FFC)
of some time-honored nonlinear phenomena in plasmas and self-gravitating
systems. We focus in particular on nonlinear Landau damping and collisionless
equilibria, which are likely important pieces of the unsolved puzzle of
neutrino oscillations in core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. Our
analysis additionally reveals the previously unexplored phenomenon of
flavor-wave synchronization.

Abstract: Swift J174610.4-290018, a peculiar transient X-ray source originally
discovered by the Swift satellite in February 2024 at the onset of its
outburst, recently attracted intentional or coincident follow-up X-ray
observations using Swift, NuSTAR and Chandra. We have performed a comprehensive
analysis of the relevant X-ray data to investigate the spectral and temporal
properties of this source between October 2000 and July 2024. Archival Chandra
data reveal a plausible additional outburst in 2005, followed by a quiescent
state in the next $\sim$19 years. The X-ray spectra in both the quiescent and
outburst phases are consistent with a thermal plasma spectrum with relatively
high temperatures ($\sim$10 keV) and prominent emission lines from both neutral
and highly-ionized iron. A previously proposed low-mass X-ray binary/accretion
disk corona scenario for Swift J174610, based on XRISM observations near the
peak of the 2024 outburst, is examined against the newly derived X-ray
properties and is disfavored, in particular due to its difficulty in explaining
the quiescent state spectrum. Instead, we suggest a symbiotic binary/recurrent
nova scenario, which gains support from many of the observed X-ray properties
of Swift J174610 and a close comparison with the famous Galactic recurrent nova
RS Oph. If confirmed, Swift J174610 would represent the first nova detected in
the Galactic center, offering new insights into the otherwise elusive
population of massive white dwarfs as well as wide binaries in the close
vicinity of Sgr A*. Our findings call for multi-wavelength follow-up
observations for this highly unusual X-ray source.
