With a peak absolute B-band magnitude of -19.96 mag, and a lack of secondary maximum in near-infrared and i-band light curves make it resemble 2003fg-like events. The slowly evolving light curves, and the earliest spectrum showing CII absorption lines, further support this classification. Fireball model fit to early light curves yields a time of first light of -16.43 days relative to B-band maximum. The first detection occurs 1.51 days before the onset of the fireball-like flux rise. This early emission, and $(g - r)_0$ color, is inconsistent with circumstellar or companion interaction. Instead, shallow $^{56}$Ni mixing or an asymmetric $^{56}$Ni distribution offers a plausible explanation. SN2021hem is the fifth known 2003fg-like SN with early-time excess flux emission. The estimated mass of radioactive $^{56}$Ni in SN2021hem is $1.00\\pm0.09 M_\\odot$. Deep GTC imaging obtained 2.5 yr after the explosion (with $m_{lim,r}=24.4$ mag and $\u03bc_{lim,r} = 26.3\\rm~mag~arsec^{-2}$), reveals no coincident host, thereby ruling out most faint dwarf and UDGs. Alternatively, assuming the nearest plausible host galaxy, at a distance of 102 kpc, implies a hyper-velocity progenitor ejected at $\\sim$2200 km/s. A faint diffuse feature ~6 kpc from the SN site has also been detected in the image, with its surface brightness of a UDGs. However, it is unclear whether it is a galaxy and is associated with SN2021hem. Considering its large normalized directional light distance ($d_{DLR}\\sim3-4$) from SN, and its unusual elongation, it is a candidate of low probability to be the host galaxy of SN2021hem. These results identify SN2021hem as one of the strongest candidates for a hostless SN Ia, underscoring the diversity of luminous, slowly evolving, 2003fg-like explosions.", "AI": {"tldr": "SN 2021hem\u662f\u4e00\u9897\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u73b0\u7684Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\uff0c\u4f4d\u4e8e\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5177\u67092003fg\u7c7b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9ad8\u5149\u5ea6\u3001\u7f13\u6162\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u5149\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684CII\u5438\u6536\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76SN 2021hem\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u73b0\u7684Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u5728\u65e0\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7206\u70b8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u89c2\u6d4b\u3001\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u3001\u706b\u7403\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u6210\u50cf\u89c2\u6d4b\u6765\u7814\u7a76SN 2021hem\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "SN 2021hem\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u65e9\u671f\u8d85\u91cf\u8f90\u5c04\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u954d56\u8d28\u91cf\u4e3a1.00\u00b10.09\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u6df1\u5ea6\u6210\u50cf\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6697\u5f31\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u548c\u8d85\u5f25\u6563\u661f\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "SN 2021hem\u662f\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u65e0\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfbIa\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e862003fg\u7c7b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u901f\u629b\u5c04\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

We investigate a prominent multi-messenger flare in the quasar PKS 0446+11 to identify the processes responsible for its high-energy emission. We analyze the IceCube-240105A high-energy neutrino event together with contemporaneous observations in the gamma-ray, X-ray, optical, and radio bands. The on- and off-flare spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are modeled within a single-zone leptohadronic framework. Multi-epoch VLBA observations from the MOJAVE program provide parsec-scale polarization data that complement the multi-wavelength light curves. No significant time delay is detected between the neutrino arrival and the flares in different energy bands. This is consistent with an extremely small jet viewing angle below 1 deg, inferred from the parsec-scale polarization structure. The flare can be reproduced by the injection of a proton population and an increase of the Doppler factor from 18 to 24. We also detect an approximately 90 deg rotation of the EVPA in the parsec-scale core during the initial phase of the flare, indicating the emergence of a shock formed by the change in the bulk plasma speed. Our comprehensive multi-messenger analysis demonstrates that the extreme beaming and sub-degree viewing angle of this distant blazar can account for the observed neutrino and electromagnetic activity. These findings strengthen the case for blazars as efficient accelerators of hadrons and as significant contributors to the observed high-energy neutrino flux.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9PKS 0446+11\u7c7b\u661f\u4f53\u7684\u591a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u8000\u6591\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6781\u5c0f\u7684\u55b7\u6d41\u89c6\u89d2\uff08<1\u5ea6\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u03b4\u4ece18\u589e\u81f324\uff09\u662f\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u80fd\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u548c\u7535\u78c1\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u548c\u7535\u78c1\u8000\u6591\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc6\u522bPKS 0446+11\u591a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u8000\u6591\u4e2d\u9ad8\u80fd\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u533a\u8f7b\u5b50-\u5f3a\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790SED\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408IceCube\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0e\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7535\u78c1\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5229\u7528MOJAVE\u9879\u76ee\u7684VLBA\u89c2\u6d4b\u83b7\u53d6\u79d2\u5dee\u8ddd\u5c3a\u5ea6\u504f\u632f\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u5230\u8fbe\u4e0e\u5404\u6ce2\u6bb5\u8000\u6591\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u79d2\u5dee\u8ddd\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6838\u5fc3EVPA\u7ea690\u5ea6\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5f62\u6210\u6fc0\u6ce2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6781\u7aef\u7684\u96c6\u675f\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u4e9a\u5ea6\u7ea7\u89c6\u89d2\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u548c\u7535\u78c1\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8000\u53d8\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5b50\u6709\u6548\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u548c\u9ad8\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u901a\u91cf\u91cd\u8981\u6765\u6e90\u3002"}}

The model is capable of creating good line profile matches for both SNe, and reasonable luminosity matches for He, C, O, and Mg lines for SN 1997D -- however H$\u03b1$ and Fe I lines are too strong.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u75283D NLTE\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u4ee3\u7801ExTraSS\u5206\u6790\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u661f\u4e91\u76f8\u671f\u7684\u8c31\u7ebf\u8f6e\u5ed3\uff0c\u7814\u7a769.0\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u5bcc\u6c22\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u7684\u7206\u70b8\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eSN 1997D\u548cSN 2016bkv\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u661f\u4e91\u76f8\u671f\uff08\u7206\u70b8\u540e\u6570\u6708\u5230\u6570\u5e74\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u7ebf\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u7206\u70b8\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7NLTE\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5347\u7ea7\u540e\u76843D NLTE\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u4ee3\u7801ExTraSS\uff0c\u5bf99.0\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u5bcc\u6c22\u524d\u8eab\u661f\u76843D\u7206\u70b8\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u5149\u8c31\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u8c31\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u5339\u914dSN 1997D\u548cSN 2016bkv\u7684\u8c31\u7ebf\u8f6e\u5ed3\uff0c\u5bf9SN 1997D\u7684He\u3001C\u3001O\u3001Mg\u7ebf\u5149\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u4f46H\u03b1\u548cFe I\u7ebf\u8fc7\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "ExTraSS\u4ee3\u7801\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u661f\u4e91\u76f8\u671f\u7684\u8c31\u7ebf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u7206\u70b8\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We use a two-fluid framework with non-annihilating, asymmetric DM, both fermionic and bosonic, that interacts with ordinary matter (OM) solely through gravity. Within this framework, we track proto-neutron stars (PNSs) across their thermal and compositional evolution via quasi-static modeling over the Kelvin--Helmholtz cooling timescale. We uncover a distinct thermal signature: DM cores deepen the gravitational potential, compressing and heating the baryonic matter, while extended DM halos provide external support, leading to cooling of the stellar matter. In contrast, hyperons and other exotic baryons soften the equation of state similarly to DM cores but reduce, rather than increase, the temperature. DM thus alters both temperature and particle distribution profiles in ways that provide a clear diagnostic of its presence. DM cores also enhance compactness and shift hyperon onset, with the strongest effects during deleptonization and neutrino-transparent phases due to reduced neutrino pressure contributions. Consequently, this early thermal evolution, observable through supernova neutrino light curves and young pulsar cooling curves, offers a direct, testable probe of DM in NSs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u6e6e\u706d\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u4e24\u6d41\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6838\u5fc3\u4f1a\u52a0\u70ed\u91cd\u5b50\u7269\u8d28\uff0c\u800c\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u4f1a\u51b7\u5374\u6052\u661f\u7269\u8d28\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u548c\u5e74\u8f7b\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u51b7\u5374\u66f2\u7ebf\u63a2\u6d4b\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u63a2\u9488\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5728\u6052\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u5370\u8bb0\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7684\u70ed\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u6e6e\u706d\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6697\u7269\u8d28\uff08\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u548c\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\uff09\u7684\u4e24\u6d41\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u529b\u4e0e\u666e\u901a\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u8ddf\u8e2a\u539f\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5728\u5f00\u5c14\u6587-\u4ea5\u59c6\u970d\u5179\u51b7\u5374\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u70ed\u548c\u6210\u5206\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6838\u5fc3\u52a0\u6df1\u5f15\u529b\u52bf\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u5e76\u52a0\u70ed\u91cd\u5b50\u7269\u8d28\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u63d0\u4f9b\u5916\u90e8\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6052\u661f\u7269\u8d28\u51b7\u5374\u3002\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6838\u5fc3\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u81f4\u5bc6\u6027\u5e76\u6539\u53d8\u8d85\u5b50\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\u673a\uff0c\u5728\u8131\u8f7b\u5b50\u548c\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u900f\u660e\u9636\u6bb5\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u8d85\u5b50\u7b49\u5947\u5f02\u91cd\u5b50\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6539\u53d8\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u4e2d\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u70ed\u6f14\u5316\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002"}}

The source is located 0.4 degrees from the best-fit neutrino direction and satisfies selection criteria for VLBI-selected, radio-bright AGN that have been identified as highly probable neutrino associations. PKS 0446+11 exhibited a major gamma-ray flare in November 2023, reaching approximately 18x its 4FGL-DR4 catalog average. Around the neutrino epoch, PKS 0446+11 remained in an elevated state, with the gamma-ray flux more than six times above its catalog level, the X-ray flux an order of magnitude above the archival measurements, and the optical-UV emission also enhanced. We used Fermi-LAT, Swift-XRT/UVOT, and archival multi-wavelength data to construct multi-wavelength light curves and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). SED modeling shows that the emission is best described by a leptonic scenario, with synchrotron emission at low energies and external Compton scattering of broad-line region and dusty torus photons dominating the X-ray - gamma-ray output. A lepto-hadronic model fails to adequately reproduce the observed SED, although hadronic cascades can broadly account for the X-ray and gamma-ray spectral coverage at lower flux levels. We compute the expected neutrino flux for the hadronic scenario and compare it to the IceCube 90% upper limit.

We present the results of the 400-day observing campaign following the afterglow of long-duration (collapsar) GRB~230815A, the first one detected through this program. Typically, GRB~230815A would not otherwise receive traditional radio follow-up, given it has no known redshift and lacks comprehensive multi-wavelength follow-up due to its high line-of-sight extinction with $A_V = 2.3$. We found its early X-ray jet break at ${\\sim}0.1$ days post-burst to be at odds with the evolution of the multi-frequency radio light curves that were traced over an unusually long duration of $400$ days. The radio light curves approximately evolved (with minor deviations) according to the standard self-similar expansion for a relativistic blast wave in a homogeneous environment prior to jet break, showing no evidence for evolution in the microphysical parameters describing the electron acceleration processes. We reconcile these features by proposing a two-component jet: the early X-ray break originates from a narrow component with a half-opening angle ${\\sim}2.1^{\\circ}$, while the evolution of the radio afterglow stems from a wider component with a half-opening angle $\\gtrapprox 35^{\\circ}$. The PanRadio GRB program will establish a sample of comprehensively followed GRBs, where a rigorous inspection of their microphysical and dynamical parameters can be performed, thereby revealing the diversity of features in their outflows and environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86PanRadio\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5c04\u7ebf\u66b4\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9GRB~230815A\u7684400\u5929\u5c04\u7535\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176X\u5c04\u7ebf\u548c\u5c04\u7535\u4f59\u8f89\u6f14\u5316\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u6210\u5206\u55b7\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ea2\u79fb\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684GRB\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f97\u5230\u5c04\u7535\u8ddf\u8e2a\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5c04\u7535\u89c2\u6d4b\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6240\u6709\u5357\u534a\u7403Swift GRB\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u55b7\u6d41\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7d27\u51d1\u9635\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u3001\u591a\u5e74\u671f\u7684\u5c04\u7535\u5de1\u5929\uff0c\u5bf9GRB~230815A\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86400\u5929\u7684\u591a\u9891\u7387\u5c04\u7535\u4f59\u8f89\u8ddf\u8e2a\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0GRB~230815A\u7684\u65e9\u671fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u55b7\u6d41\u65ad\u88c2\u4e0e\u5c04\u7535\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u6f14\u5316\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5c04\u7535\u4f59\u8f89\u5728400\u5929\u5185\u57fa\u672c\u9075\u5faa\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u81a8\u80c0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u793a\u5fae\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u6210\u5206\u55b7\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u7a84\u6210\u5206\uff08\u534a\u5f20\u89d2\u7ea62.1\u5ea6\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e9\u671fX\u5c04\u7ebf\u65ad\u88c2\uff0c\u800c\u5bbd\u6210\u5206\uff08\u534a\u5f20\u89d2\u226535\u5ea6\uff09\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5c04\u7535\u4f59\u8f89\u6f14\u5316\u3002PanRadio\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u5efa\u7acb\u5168\u9762\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684GRB\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u55b7\u6d41\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

Unfortunately, there exists a longstanding discrepancy in temperature measurements of the same galaxy clusters made by the two most sensitive X-ray observatories, Chandra and XMM-Newton. The NuSTAR X-ray Observatory's greater sensitivity to the exponential turnover in the bremsstrahlung continuum allows for more precise and potentially more accurate galaxy cluster temperature estimates, especially given its unique ability to independently calibrate its optics in orbit. We present new NuSTAR spectra of 10 relaxed clusters ($5~\\mathrm{keV} < kT < 10~\\mathrm{keV}$), extracted from identical regions as previous spectra from Chandra and XMM-Newton. The 3--20~keV spectra are well fit by single temperature models, and fits done in narrower bandpasses provide no clear evidence in support of the existence of multi temperature gas. We find NuSTAR temperatures are typically $\\sim 15\\%$ higher than XMM-Newton temperatures. In contrast, good agreement is found between NuSTAR and Chandra temperatures for clusters with $kT \\lesssim 7~\\mathrm{keV}$, with Chandra measurements exceeding NuSTAR's in hotter systems. When more clusters are included, the trend is reinforced and can be extended to higher temperatures. A generic increase to Chandra's $E > 2~\\mathrm{keV}$ effective area ($\\sim 5\\%$ at 5~keV) is found to explain the trend reasonably well. These results demonstrate the potential for NuSTAR data to address the two-decade-old temperature discrepancy between Chandra and XMM-Newton.", "AI": {"tldr": "NuSTAR\u89c2\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u6e29\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5dee\u5f02\uff1aNuSTAR\u6e29\u5ea6\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4XMM-Newton\u9ad8\u7ea615%\uff0c\u800c\u4e0eChandra\u5728kT\u22727keV\u65f6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u66f4\u70ed\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dChandra\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u8d85\u8fc7NuSTAR\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0Chandra\u5728E>2keV\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9762\u79ef\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e00\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Chandra\u548cXMM-Newton\u4e24\u5927X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5929\u6587\u53f0\u5728\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u6e29\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0a\u957f\u8fbe\u4e8c\u5341\u5e74\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u7ea6\u675f\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528NuSTAR\u89c2\u6d4b10\u4e2a\u677e\u5f1b\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\uff085-10keV\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e0eChandra\u548cXMM-Newton\u76f8\u540c\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u53d6\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u5206\u67903-20keV\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u62df\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "NuSTAR\u5149\u8c31\u53ef\u7531\u5355\u6e29\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u826f\u597d\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6e29\u5ea6\u6c14\u4f53\u8bc1\u636e\u3002NuSTAR\u6e29\u5ea6\u6bd4XMM-Newton\u9ad8\u7ea615%\uff0c\u4e0eChandra\u5728\u8f83\u51b7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u4f46\u5728\u70ed\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u504f\u4f4e\u3002\u589e\u52a0Chandra\u5728E>2keV\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9762\u79ef\u7ea65%\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "NuSTAR\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u89e3\u51b3Chandra\u548cXMM-Newton\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6e29\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the SGWB from newborn magnetars and assess its detectability by the advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Einstein Telescope (ET) based on three typical formation mechanisms of magnetars, i.e., the $\u03b1-\u03a9$ dynamo, convective dynamo, and magnetic flux conservation. For the two dynamo scenarios, when calculating the SGWB, we creatively incorporate the anti-correlations between the magnetic fields and initial spin periods $P_{\\rm i}$ with the initial dipole-field distribution of newborn magnetars. For the flux-conservation scenario, a bimodal lognormal form is adopted to describe the distribution of initial dipole fields, and all magnetars are assumed to have the same $P_{\\rm i}$. Our results show that the SGWB from newborn magnetars may be undetectable by the aLIGO and ET if the magnetars are formed due to these mechanisms since the signal-to-noise ratio of the SGWB with respect to the ET for an observation time of one year is only 0.37 for the $\u03b1-\u03a9$ dynamo, $3\\times10^{-4}$ for the convective dynamo, and at most 0.21 for the flux conservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u65b0\u751f\u78c1\u661f\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\uff08SGWB\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u78c1\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff08\u03b1-\u03a9\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u3001\u5bf9\u6d41\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u548c\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u4ea7\u751f\u7684SGWB\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u88abaLIGO\u548cET\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u3002", "motivation": "\u65b0\u751f\u78c1\u661f\u56e0\u5176\u8d85\u5f3a\u78c1\u573a\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u81ea\u8f6c\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6e90\uff0c\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u6574\u4e2a\u78c1\u661f\u79cd\u7fa4\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u78c1\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u8ba1\u7b97SGWB\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e24\u79cd\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u78c1\u573a\u4e0e\u521d\u59cb\u81ea\u8f6c\u5468\u671f\u7684\u53cd\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5cf0\u5bf9\u6570\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u63cf\u8ff0\u521d\u59cb\u5076\u6781\u573a\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u78c1\u661f\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u521d\u59cb\u81ea\u8f6c\u5468\u671f\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u663e\u793aSGWB\u7684\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u5f88\u4f4e\uff1a\u03b1-\u03a9\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u4e3a0.37\uff0c\u5bf9\u6d41\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u4e3a3\u00d710^-4\uff0c\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u673a\u5236\u6700\u591a\u4e3a0.21\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u4ea7\u751f\u7684SGWB\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u88abaLIGO\u548cET\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u751f\u78c1\u661f\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u5148\u8fdbLIGO\u548c\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u3002"}}

The diffuse UHECRs flux from these sources is modelled by propagating nuclei through extragalactic space, including energy losses from interactions with cosmic photon backgrounds. The resulting UHECRs spectra are compared with observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array, with fluxes normalised at reference energies. In addition to spectral comparisons, we generate HEALPix-based sky maps and identify potential hotspots.

Revisiting the possibility of a hadron-quark FOPT from a new perspective, we examine the interplay between the coupled nature of gravity and microscopic interactions in Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations and the fundamental requirements of thermodynamic consistency in NSs. We demonstrate that a sharp FOPT manifested as a plateau in the equation of state (EOS) $P(\\varepsilon)$, i.e., pressure $P$ versus energy density $\\varepsilon$, is intrinsically incompatible with the regularity conditions of the TOV solutions. Although numerical integrations of the TOV equations with EOSs incorporating FOPTs may yield seemingly reasonable mass-radius relations consistent with current observations, such results can mask underlying inconsistencies. Our analysis thus establishes a structural consistency criterion for constraining dense-matter EOSs using NS observables, complementing existing studies of possible phase transitions in NS interiors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u7ea7\u76f8\u53d8\uff08FOPT\uff09\u5728TOV\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8d28\u91cf-\u534a\u5f84\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5b50-\u5938\u514b\u4e00\u7ea7\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5f15\u529b\u4e0e\u5fae\u89c2\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728TOV\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8026\u5408\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790TOV\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u7a0b\u72b6\u6001\uff08EOS\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u4e00\u7ea7\u76f8\u53d8\u4e0eTOV\u89e3\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5c16\u9510\u7684\u4e00\u7ea7\u76f8\u53d8\uff08\u8868\u73b0\u4e3aEOS\u4e2d\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff09\u4e0eTOV\u89e3\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7ea6\u675f\u81f4\u5bc6\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5173\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u53ef\u80fd\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Inspired by the peculiar morphology of the Pa 30 nebula, we adopt a framework in which to characterize supernova remnants under different degrees of cooling. Our cooling framework characterizes remnants with a singular parameter called $\u03b2$ that sets how rapidly the system's thermal energy is radiated or emitted away. A continuum of morphologies is created by the implementation of different cooling timescales. For $\u03b2\\gtrsim 400$, or when the cooling timescale is shorter than $\\approx \\frac{1}{400}$ of the Sedov time, the ejecta is shaped into a filamentary structure similar to Pa 30. We explain the filament creation by the formation of Rayleigh-Taylor Instability fingers where cooling has prevented the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability from overturning and mixing out the tips. The ejecta in these filaments have not decelerated and are moving almost completely ballistically at $\\approx 95-100\\%$ their free expansion speed. In this rapid cooling regime, an explosion energy $\\approx 3.5 \\times 10^{47}$ erg is inferred. We also propose the cooling mechanism required to create these structures necessitates removing energy at a rate of $2\\%$ of $E_{\\rm ej}/t$, which implies a cooling luminosity of $\\approx 10^{36}$ erg/s.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u51b7\u5374\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u51b7\u5374\u53c2\u6570\u03b2\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u540c\u51b7\u5374\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0b\u9057\u8ff9\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86Pa 30\u661f\u4e91\u7684\u4e1d\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u5230Pa 30\u661f\u4e91\u7279\u6b8a\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u7406\u89e3\u51b7\u5374\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e1d\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u51b7\u5374\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u53c2\u6570\u03b2\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u7cfb\u7edf\u70ed\u80fd\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u6216\u53d1\u5c04\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u51b7\u5374\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u9057\u8ff9\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u03b2\u2273400\u65f6\uff08\u51b7\u5374\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c0f\u4e8eSedov\u65f6\u95f4\u76841/400\uff09\uff0c\u55b7\u51fa\u7269\u4f1a\u5f62\u6210\u7c7b\u4f3cPa 30\u7684\u4e1d\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e1d\u72b6\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u55b7\u51fa\u7269\u51e0\u4e4e\u4ee5\u81ea\u7531\u81a8\u80c0\u901f\u5ea6\u768495-100%\u5f39\u9053\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u63a8\u65ad\u7206\u70b8\u80fd\u91cf\u7ea6\u4e3a3.5\u00d710^47 erg\uff0c\u51b7\u5374\u5149\u5ea6\u7ea6\u4e3a10^36 erg/s\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5feb\u901f\u51b7\u5374\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236Kelvin-Helmholtz\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdbRayleigh-Taylor\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u624b\u6307\u7684\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e1d\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u4ee5\u7ea62% E_ej/t\u7684\u901f\u7387\u79fb\u9664\u80fd\u91cf\u3002"}}
