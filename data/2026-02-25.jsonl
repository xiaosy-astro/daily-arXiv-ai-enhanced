Extracting this information with standard hierarchical methods is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the problem and the computational cost of global-fit analyses. We present a simulation-based inference framework to measure the population properties of galactic binaries directly from the reconstructed foreground. Adopting an astrophysically agnostic parametrization in the observable space -- defined by signal amplitude, frequency, and frequency derivative -- we generate synthetic catalogs and foreground spectra using a global-fit-inspired subtraction algorithm. We then train a neural posterior estimator to map spectra to population parameters. We validate our method on simulated data and recover population parameters with good accuracy, including the total number of binaries. As a by-product, we present a GPU-accelerated version of the subtraction algorithm, which delivers a ~100X speed-up compared to previous implementations in the literature. Our results demonstrate that LISA's stochastic foreground alone carries significant information about the Galactic binary population and provide a practical step toward joint inference from resolved and unresolved sources."}

Version accepted in MNRAS", "summary": "Tidal disruption events which repeat on timescales of months-to-years represent an unambiguous signature of a partial disruption, with the surviving stellar remnant returning to pericentre to be repeatedly stripped by tidal forces. These systems therefore offer the best laboratories to study the differences between partial and full disruptions. One noteworthy observational difference between the two systems is that all known X-ray bright repeating TDEs show rapid transitions between thermal, non-thermal and completely dim states on timescales much shorter than full (non-repeating) TDEs. We argue this can be simply understood as being due to the reduction in fuel supply available to the disk, and that these systems provide evidence that all tidal disruption events undergo a state transition at Eddington ratios $f_{\\rm edd} = L_{\\rm bol}/L_{\\rm edd} \\sim 0.01$, similar to X-ray binaries. {As part of this calculation we derive a general expression for the time taken for a TDE disk to fall to a given Eddington fraction, which will be of use to both full and partial TDE science.} Perhaps surprisingly, the late-time optical/UV plateau luminosity observed from these systems is largely unaffected by this reduction in fuel supply, provided the outer disk remains in a thermal state for long enough for this emission to be detected. We then show that collisions between the returning stellar remnant and the disk formed from the last passage will produce potentially observable X-ray flares ($L_{\\rm flare} \\simeq 10^{42}$ erg/s), but that they are likely to be very difficult to detect as they are generally short-lived ($t_{\\rm flare} \\simeq 0.1-1$ hr)."}

In this work, we study the properties of 8 FDs electrons (including positrons) between 2 GeV and 20 GeV from January, 2016 to March, 2024, with the Dark Matter Particle Explorer. The maximum decrease amplitudes of these events are about 30% - 15%, and the amplitudes reduce with energy. The recovery time of these events shows diverse behaviors of their energy-dependence. Some of them show strong energy-dependence, while some have a nearly constant recovery time.

A total of 39 bursts were detected, allowing for a detailed search for burst oscillations, which had not been previously observed from this source. We report the discovery of burst oscillations at 447.7$-$448.0 Hz from SRGA J144459.2$-$604207 using XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data, consistent with the spin frequency of the NS. The strongest burst oscillation in the XMM-Newton data occurred with a single-trial significance of $5.1σ$ and maximum $Z^2$ power of $\\sim31$. In the NuSTAR data, the strongest oscillation signal has a significance of $5.2σ$ and maximum $Z^2$ power of $\\sim32$. The folded pulse profile corresponding to the strongest signal in the 0.5-10 keV band of the XMM-Newton data shows a sinusoidal shape with a fractional rms amplitude of $\\sim8.5\\%$, while the measurements of the NuSTAR data (3-40 keV range) yield $\\sim21\\%$.

Additionally, we report the detection of 447.6 Hz oscillations occurring just before a burst onset observed with XMM-Newton.

Hence, this work provides the first indication of the possible existence of such a ``nuclear Urca process\". The observation of MAXI J1752$-$457 implies a hot ignition layer with a maximum temperature of $\\sim4~{\\rm GK}$, located near the Urca shell in the ocean, such that the nuclear Urca process becomes dominant for up to $\\sim2$ days after the superburst. This behavior is distinct from that of normal Type-I X-ray bursts, which are triggered by hydrogen or helium burning in much shallower layers than those of superbursts. Our findings enable probing of superburst ashes through Urca pairs via long-term monitoring of crust cooling on day-long timescales."}

In the southwestern region, the forward shock is thought to have reached the cavity wall, encountering diverse environmental conditions. We report on the spatially resolved X-ray polarimetric observation of RCW 86 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). In the 2--4.5 keV energy band we find no significant detection of polarization. Employing a dedicated background subtraction procedure and Bayesian spectropolarimetric fitting, we derive 99% upper limits on the polarization degree of the synchrotron component: 15% in higher-statistics regions and 30%--40% in lower-statistics regions. These upper limits on the polarization degree in several regions exclude the possibility of a strongly coherent magnetic field down to the subparsec scale, and that of a moderately coherent one on the scale of the synchrotron features as resolved by IXPE. The results indicate that the shocks in the southwestern rim of RCW 86 propagate more slowly than the unshocked ejecta at their locations, yet exceed the measured proper motion speeds. This behavior is consistent with reflected shocks occurring in tenuous regions of the shocked ejecta, distinct from regions that are radio-bright."}

Some light curves show signs of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs), which may encode clues regarding the physical processes behind the emission or point to supermassive binary black holes. We analyzed five blazars with previously reported high significance year-long QPOs, applying the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and Weighted Wavelet Z-transform methods to Fermi-LAT data up to early 2025. We furthermore examined an additional source (PKS 0139-09), where nascent QPO may be present. As the light curves showed longer term trends, we detrended the data using an STL decomposition, which often revealed a large seasonal component. We find that detrending generally leads to an increase in the strength of the QPO signal. However, except for PG 1553+113, where a clearly persistent QPO signal is present, we detect transience on a timescale of $\\lesssim$4000 days. We then forecast the light curves over the following four years, using a traditional statistical method as well as a Transformer-based deep learning model. Applied to a test set, the latter showed significant success in predicting behavior that seems unexpected from simple inspection of the past data. Analyzing the extended time series suggests a markedly weaker QPO signals over the coming years in cases where the transient behavior appears near the end of the observational data. In contrast, in the nascent candidate QPO source (PKS 0139-09) the signal is expected to strengthen significantly. These predictions, which may reflect the physical origin of the QPOs, can be tested against future data."}

Moreover, the Fisher information in both SSC and EC models exhibit strong fluctuations across the parameter space, but since the magnitudes are orders of magnitude lower in EC, limits of parameter inference are expected to be worse in FSRQ SEDs than BL Lacs. We also find that the Doppler factor $δ$ carries at least $10^{2-3}$ more Fisher information than that for $p$ and $B$ in both EC and SSC, making $δ$ the most constrained SED parameter. Applying our Fisher Information motivated framework to real flaring SEDs of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) CTA 102 and 3C 279, we show that mild variations in $δ$ and $p$ can appreciably produce the flaring SEDs starting from the quiescent model, while two other flares in 3C 279 simple geometric and spectral considerations cannot reproduce the flares, reducing the efficacy of one-zone models. We propose that time-resolved SED models are indispensable to constraining physical parameters in EC-dominated blazars."}

However, the complexity of the merger process complicates the interpretation of the associated gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signals. This picture becomes even more complex in the potential scenario in which dark matter accumulates around and in neutron stars, altering their structure and the associated observables. In this work, we study synthetic gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star mergers with next-generation detectors, investigating their potential to extract both nuclear physics and dark-matter constraints. We also examine how the potential presence of fermionic, non-interacting dark matter inside neutron stars affects the inference of nuclear empirical parameters. We find that combining observations can tighten constraints on nuclear empirical parameters. However, the inferred values remain sensitive to systematic modeling biases and intrinsic degeneracies among the parameters. Conversely, our analysis reveals that even in the presence of dark matter, it will be unlikely to find decisive evidence for dark matter when analyzing gravitational-wave signals. Consequently, systematic biases in nuclear empirical parameter inference potentially resulting from the presence of dark matter are expected to be negligible even for observations with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors."}

The Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) offers unprecedentedly detailed measurements of the radio emission footprint. However, fully exploiting this information requires advanced reconstruction techniques. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for air shower reconstruction based on Bayesian inference and Information Field Theory (IFT). Our method is built on a fully differentiable forward model of the radio signal, which incorporates a physical emission parameterization and a precise wavefront model. Additionally, we augment this physical model with Gaussian processes to account for systematic uncertainties in both the signal fluence and arrival timing. By leveraging gradient information, our approach enables efficient (three orders of magnitude acceleration w.r.t.\\ the legacy method) and robust inference of the underlying physical shower parameters, such as primary energy and the depth of shower maximum, $X_\\text{max}$. This work provides not only point estimates but also a rigorous quantification of uncertainties. We achieve a resolution in $X_\\text{max}$ of $25\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^2}$ and a radiation energy resolution of $12\\%$ on simulations for LOFAR."}

It is also known for its rapid X-ray variability, on timescales of kilo-seconds and has a complex, multi component wind in both the soft X-ray and Fe K bands. Here we present the first high resolution XRISM Resolve spectrum of NGC 4051, which was captured in a historically bright state for a 150 ks exposure. XRISM resolves two blue-shifted Fe K shell absorption troughs in the mean spectrum, which can be ascribed to H-like iron and arises from two outflow components with outflow velocities of 0.025c and 0.04c. A time dependent spectral analysis shows that the iron K absorption is variable on timescales of less than a day, increasing in velocity over the duration of the observation. The velocity changes may be explained either by the passage of two separate transiting absorbers, of different velocities, or by a single accelerating outflow of approximately constant column density. In the latter case, the wind acceleration is likely to be too large to be caused by radiation pressure and instead magnetic driving is favored to accelerate the wind up to 0.04c. The outflow can originate from an accretion disk wind, whose kinetic power is sub-Eddington in contrast to recent examples of winds from powerful, luminous quasars observed by XRISM."}

Polarization signatures offer a promising new avenue to discriminate between the various GRB prompt emission models. The aim of this study is to estimate energy and time resolved polarization signatures resulting from Inverse Compton (IC) scattering for two specific GRB prompt emission models, namely the backscatter-dominated cork model by \\citet{Vyas2} and a Compton drag model by \\citet{Lazzati2}. In order to achieve this we apply an IC polarization Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm to those two GRB models in order to estimate the expected polarization signatures. For the backscatter-dominated cork model we find polarization signatures below $\\sim 10$~\\%, likely below the detection limits of current or near-future X-ray and $γ$-ray polarimeters. Our results for the Compton drag model indicates polarization results consistent with that found by \\citet{Lazzati3}. Furthermore, we find some energy and time dependence of the estimated polarization, particularly for the polarization angle."}

Using the post-eruption AAVSO light curve, we have calculated the orbital period of V1674 Her to be 0.153 days. There is no unambiguous white dwarf spin period in our data. The optical spectra show that the ionisation increases with time. A morpho-kinematic analysis of the H$α$ line profile indicates a bipolar morphology with polar blobs and an equatorial ring. Lyman beta fluorescence is found to be the dominant mechanism for the excitation of neutral oxygen. On day 19.87, [Ne III] & [Ne V] lines are present, indicating the presence of the ONe white dwarf. On day 147.66, the nebular lines are still present, implying that the nova had not gone into quiescence yet; this spectrum is accretion-dominated."}

This follows from the large separation of scales between the GW regime required for creating eccentric mergers in LVK, and the underlying astrophysical formation environment. Our analytical solution shows exceptional agreement with numerical studies. This finding has important implications for both theoretical studies and ongoing searches for eccentric GW sources."}

The coronal regions in the hearts of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been proposed as the most promising sites for such hidden nonthermal particle production, and NGC 1068 is expected to be the most neutrino-active galaxy for IceCube. We demonstrate that the latest all-sky neutrino spectrum, exhibiting a spectral bend around 3-30 TeV, is consistent with predictions of the magnetically powered corona scenario, and the models for the all-sky neutrino flux can simultaneously explain the multimessenger data from NGC 1068 within observational and modeling uncertainties. We further show, in a largely model-independent way, that the contribution from NGC 1068-like sources does not overshoot the observed medium-energy neutrino flux. Finally, we highlight the key role of the Eddington ratio, which can drive substantial variations in the predicted neutrino fluxes of nearby AGNs, and we encourage systematic multimessenger searches for the neutrino-brightest AGNs."}
