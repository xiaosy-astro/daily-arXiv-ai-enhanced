I: Curvilinear Special Relativistic Module", "comment": "30 pages, 12 figures", "summary": "Entity is a new-generation, fully open-source particle-in-cell (PIC) code developed to overcome key limitations in astrophysical plasma modeling, particularly the extreme separation of scales and the performance challenges associated with evolving, GPU-centric computing infrastructures. It achieves hardware-agnostic performance portability across various GPU and CPU architectures using the Kokkos library. Crucially, Entity maintains a high standard for usability, clarity, and customizability, offering a robust and easy-to-use framework for developing new algorithms and grid geometries, which allows extensive control without requiring edits to the core source code. This paper details the core general-coordinate special-relativistic module. Entity is the first PIC code designed to solve the Vlasov-Maxwell system in general coordinates, enabling a coordinate-agnostic framework that provides the foundational structure for straightforward extension to arbitrary coordinate geometries. The core methodology achieves numerical stability by solving particle equations of motion in the global orthonormal Cartesian basis, despite using generalized coordinates like Cartesian, axisymmetric spherical, and quasi-spherical grids. Charge conservation is ensured via a specialized current deposition technique using conformal currents. The code exhibits robust scalability and performance portability on major GPU platforms (AMD MI250X, NVIDIA A100, and Intel Max Series), with the 3D particle pusher and the current deposition operating efficiently at about 2 nanoseconds per particle per timestep. Functionality is validated through a comprehensive suite of standard Cartesian plasma tests and the accurate modeling of relativistic magnetospheres in curvilinear axisymmetric geometries."}

In addition to our Hα images, we have obtained matched continuum images which we subtract to reveal faint emission, including a far more extensive network of optical knots and filaments than reported previously. The deepest images also show an extremely faint, fairly diffuse arc of emission surrounding much of the circumference of Tycho to the southeast and south, coinciding with the rim of the radio/X-ray shell. We have measured proper motions for 46 filaments, including many fainter ones near the Tycho outer rim. Our measurements are generally consistent with previous ones by Kamper and vandenBergh (1978), but ours have far greater precision. Most optical filaments at the shell rim have expansion indices reasonably consistent with the Sedov value (0.40), while the interior filaments have somewhat smaller values, as expected. From the combination of proper motions of filaments at the shell rim and shock velocity at the same positions, one should be able to calculate the distance to Tycho by simple geometry. Determination of the shock velocity from broad Balmer-line profiles is subject to model uncertainties, but the availability of dozens of such filaments with a range of conditions offers the possibility to substantially improve the distance determination for Tycho."}

The source was initially speculated to be a white dwarf (WD) pulsar system due to its short period ($P\\sim12$ min) and highly-modulated optical lightcurves. Our observations revealed a variable X-ray counterpart extending up to 40 keV with an X-ray luminosity of $L_X \\sim 3\\times10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (0.3--40 keV). Utilizing timing data from XMM and NICER, we detected a periodic signal at $P_{\\rm spin}=12.2640(7)\\pm0.0583$ min with $>6σ$ significance. The pulsed profile displays $\\sim 25\\%$ and $\\sim10\\%$ modulation in the 0.3--2 and 2--10 keV bands, respectively. Broadband X-ray spectra are best characterized by an absorbed optically-thin thermal plasma model with $kT \\approx 25$ keV and a Fe K-$α$ fluorescent line at 6.4 keV. The bright and hard X-ray emission rules out the possibility of a WD pulsar or ultra-compact X-ray binary. The high plasma temperature and Fe emission lines suggest that ZTF J1851 is an intermediate polar spinning at 12.264 min. We employed an X-ray spectral model composed of the accretion column emission and X-ray reflection to fit the broadband X-ray spectra. Assuming spin equilibrium between the WD and the inner accretion disk, we derived a WD mass range of $M_{\\rm WD}=(1.07\\rm{-}1.32)M_{\\odot}$ exceeding the mean WD mass of IPs ($\\langle M_{\\rm WD} \\rangle = 0.8 M_\\odot)$. Our findings illustrate that follow-up broadband X-ray observations could provide unique diagnostics to elucidate the nature of periodic optical sources anticipated to be detected in the upcoming Rubin all-sky optical surveys."}

For this binary, we performed a timing analysis using 16 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope, covering the period from 2008 August to 2024 October. Our analysis detected an orbital modulation with a period of 0.2279781 days at a significance level of $\\sim4σ$, which is in good agreement with previous findings. However, unlike previous reports, we identified a transition in the orbital modulation around 2021 August, after which the orbital signal disappeared. We speculate that the system may be undergoing a transition from a rotation-powered to an accretion-powered state at this epoch. Additionally, we conducted the phase-resolved and spectral analyses, and in the phase-resolved results, we observed an anti-correlation between its $γ$-ray and X-ray emissions, which consistent with the predictions of high-energy radiation models for such systems. We provide some predictive discussions based on the results of $γ$-ray data analysis, and future Fermi-LAT observations will determine whether these predictions hold true."}

UHECR protons that escape the source interact with the cosmic background radiation, producing a PeV-EeV cosmogenic neutrino spectrum. The secondary $e^\\pm$ and $γ$-rays initiate an electromagnetic cascade, resulting in a cosmogenic $γ$-ray spectrum that peaks at a delayed time due to deflection of charged particles in the extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF). Our results shed light on the nature of the UHECR source for the $ν_μ$ event and provide crucial insights into the detection of multi-TeV $γ$-rays of cosmogenic origin from similar past cosmological transients. Using the $γ$-ray sensitivity of currently operating and next-generation imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, the flux and time-delay distribution can constrain the source distance. We further show that the detection of such a $γ$-ray signal above the background depends on the EGMF strength. Together with the non-detection of coincident spatial or temporal photon counterparts at the current epoch, this detection is the first compelling candidate for a sub-EeV cosmogenic neutrino."}

The broken power law emerges as the most common spectral shape, accounting for 60\\% of pulsars, while the simple power law describes only 13.5\\%, with 68.8\\% of pulsars decisively favoring curved or broken models. We further identify 74 confident gigahertz-peaked spectrum pulsars, and demonstrate that millisecond pulsars frequently exhibit spectral curvature. A key finding is that the previously reported dominance of the simple power law was largely a statistical artifact of the frequentist method used in earlier work. These findings substantially revise the prevailing view of pulsar spectra and establish a critical, model-classified foundation for future theoretical work."}

Based on observational data of SVOM/GRM and Fermi/GBM, we perform a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis for individual pulse in the prompt emission of this burst, and novel characteristics are revealed. Firstly, opposite evolutions of spectral lag are found in the first and third pulse of this burst. Second, the large negative lag of the first pulse is an outlier in short GRB sample, especially when the pulse duration is considered. Spectral analysis shows that the negative lag of the first pulse is caused by the evolution of spectrum index, and is irrelevant to Epeak, which is inconsistent with the previous study. The intrinsic mechanism is probably attributed to electron cooling in the decaying magnetic field, which leads to the continuous hardening of the spectrum index and results in negative lag. Furthermore, spectral analysis also shows that the third pulse is more likely to be described by a quasi-thermal spectrum, indicating the existence of photospheric emission. It is difficult to explain how the synchrotron radiation appears before photospheric emission in a single GRB and some assumptions are discussed."}

It is found that the flux of the photon ring increases simultaneously as the flux of the direct ring, which brightens first, decreases, and then gradually diminishes, when the increase in emissivity persists for $15 t_{\\rm g}$ with $t_{\\rm g}$ being the light crossing time of the gravitational radius. The direct ring is formed by photons emitted from the vicinity of the innermost region of the disk and traveling directly to the observer without orbiting around the black hole, while the photon ring is formed by photons passing near the spherical photon orbit. The time-averaged width of the dark region between the direct ring and the photon ring (dark crescent) becomes thinner when the spin parameter is higher and the increase in the emissivity of the accretion disk is greater. The time variation of two rings also causes the intensity-weighted center to oscillate both in the direction of the black hole's angular momentum vector projected onto the screen ($Y$-direction) and in the perpendicular direction ($X$-direction). The amplitude of oscillatory time variation in the $X$-direction becomes large when the spin parameter is higher, and that in the $Y$-direction becomes large when the increase in the emissivity of the disk is large. The spin parameter can be estimated by combining the time-averaged dark crescent width and the ratio of the amplitudes in the $X$- and $Y$-directions. This method is applicable when the duration of the increase in emissivity of the accretion disk ranges at least from approximately 10-20 $t_{\\rm g}$."}

A strategy is presented to improve the potential of the KM3NeT neutrino telescope to detect core-collapse supernovae in our Galaxy or the Large Magellanic Cloud by further exploiting the properties of its optical modules equipped with multiple photomultipliers. A supernova burst is expected to produce a sudden hit rate increase in the KM3NeT detectors. New observables have been defined for individual optical modules that exploit the geometry and time distribution of the detected hits, enabling a better discrimination between signal and background signatures. In addition, a thorough investigation of the related systematic uncertainties is presented for the first time. When implemented, this new methodology allowed KM3NeT to probe 46% more Galactic core-collapse supernova candidates than with the previous trigger strategy, reaching the dense Galactic bulge.

In this work, we present order-of-magnitude calculations of the energetics associated with this proposed jet-NLR interaction.

This mechanism provides a natural explanation for the optical spectral variability recorded with the X-shooter and Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instruments. Our results support the scenario in which feedback from the relativistic jet can dynamically influence the circumnuclear gas, offering new insights into the coupling between jets and the NLR in $γ$-ray-emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies."}

A promising delayed channel involves the formation of FRB-emitting neutron stars through merger- or accretion-induced collapse of a massive white dwarf (WD). By simulating a realistic stellar population with both binaries and triples, we identify pathways to WD collapse that could produce FRB candidates. We find that (i) triple dynamics open new merger channels inaccessible to isolated binaries, significantly enhancing the overall merger rate; (ii) triple-induced mergers broaden the delay-time distribution, producing long-delay ($\\gtrsim1$-8~Gyr) events largely independent of metallicity, alongside a shorter-delay population ($\\lesssim100$~Myr) of rapid mergers; (iii) these long delays naturally yield FRBs in older environments such as quiescent host galaxies and galactic halos; (iv) when convolved with the cosmic star-formation history, binary channels track the star-formation rate ($z_{\\rm peak} \\sim 2$), while triple channels peak later ($z_{\\rm peak} \\sim 1$), giving a combined local source rate of $R_0 \\approx 2\\times10^4~{\\rm Gpc^{-3}~yr^{-1}}$, consistent with observations; and (v) applying the same framework to Type~Ia supernovae, we find that triples extend the delay-time tail and roughly double the Ia efficiency relative to binaries, yielding rates and redshift evolution in good agreement with observations. If FRBs originate from the collapse of WDs, our results establish triples, alongside binaries, as a crucial and previously overlooked formation pathway whose predicted rates, host demographics, and redshift evolution offer clear tests for upcoming surveys."}

Raiteri"], "title": "The variability of blazars throughout the electromagnetic spectrum", "comment": "Review article published by The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review", "summary": "With their jet pointing towards us, blazars are ideal tools to study the physics and structure of extragalactic jets. Their powerful jets are cosmic particle accelerators and are alleged to be one of the production sites of the high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube Observatory. Doppler beaming of the jet nonthermal radiation increases blazar brightness, blue-shifts their emission, and shortens their variability time scales, which are observed to range from years down to minutes. This review will focus on blazar flux, spectral, and polarization variability across the electromagnetic spectrum. Interpretation of blazar variability calls into question both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Shock waves, magnetic reconnection, and turbulence can accelerate particles inside the jet, while jet precession, rotation, and twisting can produce variations in Doppler beaming. Microvariability puts strong constraints on the size of the emitting regions, suggesting a multizone emitting jet. Twisting jets have been proposed to explain the long-term multiwavelength variability. They are supported by radio observations of bent or helical jets, and by results of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of plasma jets. Detection of (quasi)periodic behaviour has been ascribed to orbital motion in black hole binary systems, jet precession, kink instabilities developing inside the jet, or perturbations in the accretion disc. Gravitational microlensing has been suggested to explain blazar behaviour in some cases. Polarization provides information on the structure and behaviour of the magnetic field in the emission zones. Both the degree and angle of polarization can show strong and fast variability, which is sometimes correlated with flux. The interpretation of flux, spectral, and polarization variability within a consistent picture challenges current models of blazar variability."}

These transients are rare, and increasing the current sample is paramount to understand them. As part of the Fink alert broker, we have developed an early detection system for TDEs for the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data. In this paper, we report on the optical transients we found either during the development of this tool, or when applying the classifier to the existing archive. We use this sample to anticipate what improvements to the TDE detection systems will need to be implemented for future surveys. For all the transients, we present optical and infrared archival photometry from ZTF, WISE, and Catalina, and assess the previous nuclear activity of the host. We fit the ZTF lightcurves with both a phenomenological and a physically-motivated model. We report on a total of 19 optical nuclear transients, out of which nine are in passive galaxies, eight in active galaxies, and two for which the activity of the host is uncertain. Two transients are newly discovered repeated TDE candidates, and we compare them to the current sample of repeated optical nuclear transients. One transient is exceptionally long-lived (over 5 years), in an until-now passive galaxy. Three of the TDE-like flares in active galaxies have absolute g-band magnitudes brighter than -24, making them new Extreme Nuclear Transient (ENT) candidates. One seemingly repeated object was revealed to be two independent supernovae in the same galaxy. This sample shows both the potential of our detection system for future discovery, and the relevance of archival searches to reveal overlooked transients. It also raises several points of concern and avenues of improvement for current and future classifiers."}

Ejection of CEs leads to tightened stellar orbits capable of forming compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. As these mergers are seen by gravitational-wave (GW) detectors such as LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA (LVK), we ask what the merger rates of compact binaries in LVK tell us about the fraction of LRNe that lead to the formation of compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. Using the observed volumetric rates of LRNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and of compact binary mergers from LVK observations, we derive limits on the fraction of LRNe that produce compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. Assuming the LRNe rate closely follows the star formation rate at any redshift, we use the delay time distribution models for compact binaries to compute the compact binary merger rate. A comparison of this merger rate with the latest volumetric rates of compact binary mergers from the fourth GW transient catalog (GWTC-4) at the present epoch of LVK allows us to constrain the above fraction. We find that only a fraction as small as $\\sim 10^{-3}$ (median) of the LRNe correspond to the GW-observed binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This potentially implies that the majority of the LRNe population will not lead to mergers of compact objects, but other end products, such as stellar mergers."}

Historically, the apparent speeds of black hole x-ray binary (BHXRBs) jets have been observed to be lower than jet speeds from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and specifically blazars. In this work, we show that selection effects could be the primary cause of the observed population differences. For the first time, it is possible to perform a statistical analysis of the underlying BHXRB jet Lorentz factor distribution. We use both the Anderson-Darling test and apply nested sampling to this problem. With Bayes factors, we confirm that the Lorentz factor distribution of BHXRBs is best described with a power law, the same model that has been applied to AGN jets. For a Lorentz factor distribution following $\\rm N(Γ) \\propto Γ^b$ we find a value for the exponent of $b=-2.64_{-0.55}^{+0.46}$. This exponent is consistent with values found in AGN population studies, within $1σ$ for \\textit{Swift}-BAT and \\textit{Fermi}-LAT selected AGN. The best-fit exponent for the radio selected MOJAVE sample is just above our $2 σ$ limit. This is a remarkable agreement given the different scales at which the jets are observed. The observed slower apparent speeds in BHXRBs are largely due to the much larger inclinations in this sample. Furthermore, nested sampling confirms that $Γ_{\\rm max}$ is completely unconstrained using this method. Therefore, based on kinematics alone, BHXRB jets are broadly consistent with being just as relativistic as those from supermassive black holes."}

One potential candidate for dark matter is a weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP), which is predicted by various extensions to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. After becoming gravitationally bound in cosmic structures, WIMPs can self-annihilate and produce SM particles including neutrinos, which are observable by detectors like IceCube. We present a search for neutrinos from low-mass $(\\leq 300 \\, \\mathrm{GeV})$ WIMP annihilation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies with over seven years of IceCube livetime.

Observations of GW190814 and GW230529 highlight the challenges gravitational waves face in distinguishing neutron stars from black holes. Interpreting these systems is especially difficult because classifications depend simultaneously on measurement noise, compact binary population models, and equation of state (EOS) constraints on the maximum neutron star mass. We analyze 66 confident events from GWTC-3 to quantify how the probability of a component being a neutron star, P(NS), varies across the population. The effects are substantial, the dominant drivers of classification are the pairing preferences of neutron stars with other compact objects, and the neutron star spin distributions. The data reveals that P(NS) varies between 1% - 67% for GW230529's primary and between 51% - 100% for GW190425's primary. By contrast, P(NS) for GW190814's secondary varies by <10%, demonstrating robustness from its high signal-to-noise ratio and small mass ratio. Analysis using EOS information tends to affect P(NS) through the inferred maximum neutron star mass rather than the maximum spin. As it stands, P(NS) remains sensitive to numerous population parameters, limiting its reliability and potentially leading to ambiguous classifications of future GW events."}

In this work we quantify for the first time how a joint detection of these effects can be used to constrain the underlying dynamics and environment of the lensed GW source. We consider a range of different astrophysical environments, from massive clusters to stellar triples, and find that binary black hole (BBH) mergers in Active Galactic Nuclei disks (AGN-disks) are particularly likely to have orbital parameters that can be constrained through our considered lensing setup. Applying these methods to the upcoming catalog of cosmologically strongly lensed GW sources will open up new possibilities for probing their origin and underlying formation mechanisms."}

While at gamma-rays we can not spatially resolve the lensed images, a macrolensing-induced time pattern is expected in the blazar's lightcurve, resulting from the delay between variable gamma-ray components originating from its two brightest lensed images. Compared to our previous study, here we employ high-quality lightcurves coupled with prolonged outburst activity, and improved time-series techniques. Analyzing six independent data segments, we identified a delay of 20.26 +/- 0.62 days (statistical and stochastic uncertainty), with a chance detection probability at the 2.5 x $10^{-5}$ level (post-trial). We also present a novel approach to the magnification ratio estimate based on a comparison with simulated data. Our work suggests that the gamma-ray flux ratio between the two main lens components is $μ_γ \\lesssim$ 1.8. We do not observe convincing evidence of microlensing effects, as previously claimed. The measured gamma-ray time delay is in 2-sigma tension with radio-based estimates, suggesting either distinct emission sites, underestimated radio uncertainties, or gamma-ray production in a region opaque to radio. Our study highlights the potential of well sampled lightcurves and advanced time-series techniques to distinguish true lensing-induced delays from stochastic variability. When combined with improved radio constraints and refined lens models, PKS 1830-211 and similar sources constitute promising systems for time-delay cosmography, offering new insights into both jet structure and cosmological parameters."}
