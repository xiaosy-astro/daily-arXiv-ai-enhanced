We conducted a standard periodicity search on these data as well as a single pulse search at a range of dispersion measures. We found no convincing candidate signals, and we calculate flux density, luminosity, and single pulse fluence limits from these observations. The derived luminosity limits are comparable to the luminosities of three young, energetic pulsars (the Crab pulsar, PSR B0540$-$69, and PSR J0537$-$6910), and so we cannot rule out the existence of a pulsar in SNR 1987A with a similar radio luminosity."}

However, when one wishes to be precise and quantify the amount of turbulence in a supernova simulation, one immediately encounters the problem that turbulence is difficult to define and measure. Using the 3D magnetohydrodynamic code ELEPHANT, we study how different definitions of turbulence change one's conclusions about the amount of turbulence in a supernova and the extent to which it helps the explosion. We find that, while all the definitions of turbulence we use lead to a qualitatively similar growth pattern over time of the turbulent kinetic energy in the gain region, the total amount of turbulent kinetic energy, and especially the ratios of turbulent to total kinetic energy, distinguish them. Some of the definitions appear to indicate turbulence is a necessary contributor to the explosion, and others indicate it is not. The different definitions also produce turbulence maps with different correlations with maps of the enstrophy, a quantity widely regarded as also indicating the presence of turbulence. We also compute the turbulent adiabatic index and observe that in regions of low enstrophy, this quantity is sensitive to the definition used. As a consequence, the effective adiabatic index depends upon the method used to measure the turbulence and thus alter one's conclusions regarding the impact of turbulence within the supernova."}

Submitted to ApJ", "summary": "Accurate and precise measurements of neutron star radii provide invaluable information about the cold, dense matter in neutron star cores. Analyses of synthetic X-ray pulse waveform data similar to the data obtained from non-accreting neutron stars using the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) have indicated that mass and radius estimates made using such data are robust against some systematic errors that may be made when modeling these data, such as errors in the assumed pattern of the thermal X-ray emission from the surface of these stars. A potentially important but so far unexplored source of systematic error is misparameterization of unmodulated background components, which can bias the inferred radius, particularly when data from different telescopes are used in the analysis. In this study, we investigate the effects of the background model on radius estimates by jointly analyzing synthetic NICER and XMM-Newton data, using the $\\sim 2.1~M_\\odot$ pulsar PSR~J0740$+$6620 as a prototypical example. Our analysis shows that even if the background assumed in the model underestimates the actual background by a factor of more than five, the resulting shift of the radius posterior from the true value of the radius corresponds to only $\\sim1σ$. In all the cases we examined, the Bayesian evidence for the correct background model is greater than for the incorrect background model. These results add to the evidence that analyses of NICER-like data provide accurate measurements of neutron star radii when the statistical sampling is thorough and the model fits the data well."}

Although a dozen X-ray sources are found within the UHE emission site, careful analysis shows that they are unlikely to produce the observed UHE emission. The most likely particle accelerator is pulsar J1740+1000 which if offset by 13' north of the UHE source but appears to be connected to it by an extended feature seen in X-rays. For a plausible pulsar distance of 1.2 kpc, 1LHAASO J1740+0948u must be located about 5 pc away which requires rapid transport of electrons along the feature to avoid radiative losses. This poses several challenges for standard pulsar theory. Firstly, being produced $\\lesssim$ 10 kyrs ago, particles must have been accelerated to the energy corresponding to a large fraction of the pulsar's full potential drop across the polar cap. Secondly, due to the lack of TeV emission extension toward the pulsar, particles must be accumulating in the UHE region. In this context, we discuss two possible scenarios: a tail filled with pulsar wind and confined by the bow-shock due to the fast pulsar's motion and an ISM filament filled by the most energetic pulsar wind particles escaping from the apex of the bow-shock."}

It is highly plausible though, should they exist, that they would not make up all of the DM. Several studies showed that if the rest of DM is made of thermal particles, then these should accumulate around such PBHs, leading to the formation of very dense spikes in the radiation era. We contributed a detailed analytical study about this phenomenon, providing clear explanations as for the origin of scaling relations in the form of power-law density profiles with up to 3 different spectral indices, i.e. $3/4$, $3/2$, and $9/4$, and 4 asymptotic regimes. Here, we further derive an approximate analytical solution that enables fast numerical predictions for the density profiles of these spikes. We also address the specific case of self-annihilating DM species and derive new approximate analytical formulae. Our approximate density yields the correct annihilation rate within $\\pm 15\\%$ precision. We then focus on indirect detection in the cosmic microwave background and in extragalactic gamma-rays. We shed new and subtle light on how mutually exclusive PBHs and self-annihilating DM species can really be.

Comments welcome", "summary": "The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has identified several individual neutrino emitters associated with supermassive black hole accretion phenomena, including blazars, tidal disruption events, and, unexpectedly, Seyfert galaxies. A key open question is which types of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are most likely to be neutrino emitters. Here we show that high-confidence extragalactic neutrino emitters tend not only to have higher hard X-ray fluxes but also to be more variable in mid-infrared (MIR) than other AGNs in the \\textit{Swift} BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey. MIR variations effectively trace long-term fluctuations in AGN accretion disks and/or jets. In addition to the role of X-ray flux emphasized in previous studies, we speculate that long-term central engine fluctuations may also be critical for neutrino production. This hypothesis may inform IceCube neutrino-electromagnetic counterpart association studies and provide new insights into cosmic ray acceleration sites. First, the observed neutrinos are unlikely to originate from AGN host galaxies or from interactions between large-scale (dozens of parsecs) winds/outflows and the surrounding interstellar medium. Second, if neutrinos are produced in the X-ray corona, the corona should exhibit strong magnetic turbulence dissipation or magnetic reconnection whose rate changes substantially on timescales of years. Third, the relativistic jets of blazar neutrino emitters may be intrinsically unstable over years. Finally, if neutrinos are related to interactions between small-scale winds/outflows and torus clouds, such winds/outflows must be highly episodic."}

In this study, we investigate the multiwavelength variability of the blazar TON 599, a Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ), with a particular emphasis on its emission line behavior. We focus on the Mg II $λ$2798 Å emission line, a key tracer of the ionized gas in the broad-line region (BLR), and its role in jet-induced variability. In addition to optical emission lines, we analyze gamma-rays (0.1-300 GeV), X-rays (0.2-10 keV), optical continuum ($λ$3000 Å), optical polarization, and millimeter-wavelength light curves. Three cross-correlation methods are employed to investigate temporal relationships between the emission line and continuum across various wavelengths. Using the Non-Thermal Dominance (NTD) parameter, our analysis confirms that synchrotron emission dominates the continuum during active states, highlighting the jet's primary role in the observed variability. The Mg II emission line exhibits quasi-simultaneous variability with the optical continuum, suggesting photoionization driven by the jet's non-thermal radiation. Additionally, the minimal time lag between gamma-ray and optical/near-ultraviolet emissions supports a synchrotron self-Compton origin for the most variable component of the gamma-ray emission. These findings highlight the importance of emission line variability and multiwavelength observations in constraining the interaction between jets and the BLR in blazars. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of AGN emission mechanisms and the complex interplay between jets and their surrounding environments."}

In the case of rapidly spinning black holes, up to $40\\%$ of the rest-mass energy of accreting matter can be released, far exceeding the efficiency of nuclear fusion. In this work, we investigate magnetized particle motion and relativistic accretion processes around a decoupled hairy black hole via extended geometric deformation. The developed geometry involves two hairy parameters that preserve the horizon structure with the additional feature of the fulfillment of weak energy conditions outside the event horizon. We provide the foundation with necessary formalism for magnetized particle motion around a decoupled black hole. The effective potential and innermost stable circular orbits are then derived, which demonstrate a significant reduction of the radius of the latter quantity under the hairy parameters for the magnetized particle. Afterwards, we obtain exact analytical expressions for radial velocity profiles, mass accretion rates, and a few others which reveal improved energy efficiency and emissivity as compared to the standard black hole. Furthermore, the decoupling parameter shows strong influence on oscillations, accretion presenting fantastic agreement between analytical predictions and numerical simulations, and thus offering noticeable observational signatures for future gravitational wave and X-ray astronomy."}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "We present the results of deep near-infrared imaging of the recently discovered helium star pulsar binary J1928$+$1815 situated in the Galactic plane. Our observations did not achieve significant detections, providing limiting magnitudes of J=23.7 and H=22.2, which are both 2.4\\,magnitudes deeper than the expected J and H magnitudes for a modeled stripped helium star with a mass of 1\\,$\\rm M_{\\odot}$ after extinction. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of more significant extinction and the exact evolutionary status of the supposed helium star is uncertain, by comparing J1928$+$1815 with other pulsar binaries, we propose a natural alternative solution: that J1928$+$1815 is a heavyweight black widow system with a massive ablated white dwarf. Due to the pulsar's relatively high spin-down power and short orbital separation, the irradiation heating timescale is uniquely shorter than the cooling timescale for the WD companion. As a result, the WD effectively boils, with its outer layers expanding, overfilling the Roche lobe and producing low-density binary-scale haze opaque in the radio band. If this interpretation is correct, J1928$+$1815 would represent a new category distinct from canonical lightweight black widow systems. Radio eclipses can occur in pulsar binaries across a wider range of WD companion masses than previously thought. Therefore, they do not serve as a definitive indicator of a helium star without its direct detection. We contend that a spectroscopic identification remains the smoking gun for its existence. Given the crowding in this field, an \\textit{HST} imaging in the near-infrared band would provide even better constraints."}

For the first time, we extend coherence and covariance studies into the hard X-ray band up to 150 keV. We detect a clear drop in coherence above 30 keV on both short- and long-timescales relative to the 2-10 keV reference band. To investigate the origin of the coherent variability, we simultaneously fit the short- and long-timescale covariances and the time-averaged spectra with a Comptonization model. Surprisingly, the electron temperature associated with long-timescale variability is significantly higher than that on short timescales. Moreover, the temperature on long timescales remains relatively constant throughout the hard state, whereas the short-timescale temperature evolves with X-ray luminosity. We attribute the drop in coherence to multiple sources of seed photons, i.e., the blackbody and synchrotron photons. The independence between these two photon fields leads to the drop in coherence. To explain the lower electron temperature on short timescales, we propose a two-Comptonization framework in which short-timescale variability arises from a vertically extended central region, while long-timescale variability originates at larger radii. The elevated geometry of the inner region leads to illumination primarily by cooler outer-disk photons, yielding a lower electron temperature. In this case, the evolution of the height of the elevated region could explain the evolution of the electron temperature associated with the coherent variability throughout the hard state."}

The data clearly separate the relativistic broad line from the underlying continuum and from narrow emission and absorption features in the Fe band. The unprecedented spectral resolution in the Fe K band clearly demonstrates that the flux excess can be attributed to a single, broad feature, as opposed to a superposition of previously unresolved narrow features. This broad feature can be best interpreted as emission consistent with an origin near the innermost stable circular orbit around a rapidly rotating black hole. By modeling the shape of the broad line, we find a black hole spin of $a\\simeq0.98$ and an inclination of the inner accretion disk of $θ\\simeq63^\\circ$. The spin is consistent with prior reflection studies, reaffirming the robustness of past spin measurements using the relativistic reflection method. The measured inclination provides reinforcing evidence of a disk-orbit misalignment in Cygnus X-1.
