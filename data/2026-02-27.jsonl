They occur in magnetically dominated plasma and are described by relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We present global relativistic MHD simulations of monster shocks in unperturbed and perturbed (``wrinkled'') backgrounds with a global dipolar geometry. Our simulations confirm analytical predictions for equatorial shocks and provide new insight into the behavior of oblique shocks off the equator. Simulations where the shock is formed through Alfvén mode to fast mode conversion are also presented, demonstrating the generic nature of the monster shock mechanism. We explore how the presence of additional modes in the magnetosphere modifies the shock behavior. Modes of comparable amplitude can fragment the shock front, substantially reduce the magnetization, produce localized enhancements in the Lorentz factor relative to an unperturbed dipole background, and intermittently generate additional shocks along a line of sight."}

Unlike all previous unmagnetized AIC models - which predicted proton-rich, $^{56}$Ni-dominated ejecta - strong magnetic fields eject ${\\sim 0.2 M_\\odot}$ of neutron-rich material $(\\langle Y_e \\rangle \\sim 0.24)$ on dynamical timescales, before neutrino irradiation can raise the electron fraction, enabling strong $r$-process nucleosynthesis up to and beyond the third peak. The resulting kilonova is lanthanide-rich $(X_{\\rm lan} \\approx 6\\%)$ and dominated by near-infrared emission. We compute synthetic light curves in the LSST and JWST bands and find striking agreement, without parameter tuning, between the observations of AT 2023vfi/GRB 230307A and our broadband light curves for polar viewing angles. These results establish magnetized AIC as a viable channel for heavy $r$-process element production and a compelling progenitor candidate for long-duration gamma-ray bursts with kilonova signatures."}

Harris", "Srimoyee Sen"], "title": "Shock-induced chiral magnetic effect", "comment": "22 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "Weak-interaction-mediated chiral imbalance generation in idealized massless electrons during core-collapse supernovae was once proposed to be the source of strong magnetic fields found in neutron stars. The effect goes by the name of chiral plasma instability (CPI). However, it was found that a finite electron mass damps out this process, inactivating the instability and preventing magnetic field growth. In this work we show that the instability can survive in the presence of abrupt density and temperature perturbation that drives the system sufficiently far out of weak equilibrium. As an example, we work with such perturbations generated by shockwaves which are common during both core collapse as well as neutron star mergers. We find that the chiral imbalance resulting from shock waves, under the right conditions of density and temperature, can sustain the chiral plasma instability despite the damping from the electron mass. Additionally, in an already magnetized medium, the chiral magnetic effect resulting from shock wave density and temperature perturbation can generate substantial ohmic heating. Our results imply that shockwaves during core-collapse supernovae and merging neutron stars can act as a source of strong heating in a magnetized medium as well as CPI."}

Hartig"], "title": "Complex Analysis of Askaryan Radiation: UHE-$ν$ Identification and Reconstruction using the Hilbert Envelope of Observed Signals", "comment": null, "summary": "The detection of ultra-high energy neutrinos (UHE-$ν$), with enegies above 10 PeV, has been a long-time goal in astroparticle physics. Autonomous, radio-frequency (RF) UHE-$ν$ detetectors have been deployed in polar regions that rely on the Askaryan effect in ice for the neutrino signal. The Askaryan effect occurs when the excess negative charge within a UHE-$ν$ cascade radiates in a dense medium. UHE-$ν$ can induce cascades that radiate in the RF bandwidth above thermal backgrounds. To identify UHE-$ν$ signals in data from Askaryan-class detectors, analytic models of the Askaryan electromagnetic field have been created and matched to simulations and laboratory measurements. These models describe the Askaryan electromagnetic field, but leave the effects of signal propagation through polar ice and RF channel response to simulations. In this work, a fully analytic Askaryan model that accounts for these effects is presented. First, formulas for the observed voltage trace and its Hilbert envelope are calculated. Second, the analytic model is compared to UHE-$ν$ signals at 100 PeV from NuRadioMC, a key Monte Carlo toolset in the field. Correlation coefficients between the analytic signal envelope and MC data in excess of $0.94$ are found, and 99.99% of UHE-$ν$ signals pass a correlation threshold of $ρ\\geq 0.4$. Analysis of RF thermal noise reveals that just 0.2 background events have $ρ\\geq 0.4$ in 5 years at a 1 Hz thermal trigger rate. Finally, we describe future work related to the measurement of the logarithm of the UHE-$ν$ cascade energy."}

Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "GRB 250221A is a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) at redshift $z=0.768$, with a duration of 1.8 s and no extended emission in either Swift/BAT or Konus-Wind bands. A remarkable re-brightening feature in both optical and X-ray bands was observed at $\\sim 0.6$ days after the burst trigger, but no supernova or kilonova signature was detected. The burst properties and empirical correlations or distributions (e.g., duration, spectral hardness, location in the Amati correlation, $\\varepsilon-$value, $f_{\\rm eff}$ parameter, and physical offset) favor a compact binary merger origin. However, a dense circumburst medium with $n\\sim 80\\rm~cm^{-3}$, obtained by adopting the energy injection into a jet to interpret the late-time re-brightening is inconsistent with the compact binary merger origin. In this paper, we propose a two-component jet model to explain the multiwavelength afterglow observations of GRB 250221A, in which the relativistic narrow jet ($\\rm θ_{c} \\sim 3.8^\\circ$) produces the prompt and the early decay afterglow emission, while the mildly relativistic wide jet ($\\rm θ_{w} \\sim 4.4^\\circ$) dominates at later times, resulting in the observed re-brightening feature. If this is the case, one can obtain a lower medium density with $n\\sim 0.72\\rm~cm^{-3}$ which is a little bit higher than that of short GRBs in merger environments, but falls into the reasonable and acceptable range. Finally, a possible kilonova emission is also discussed within the scenario of compact star merger origin of GRB 250221A."}

Submitted to ApJL on 24 Feb 2026", "summary": "IceCube has detected neutrino emission from the Galactic Plane (GP) at a significance of $4.5σ$, though its origin remains uncertain. Utilizing ten years of IceCube muon-track data, we investigate potential correlations between the GP neutrinos and $γ$-ray sources in the first LHAASO catalog (1LHAASO). To avoid issues caused by spectral extrapolation, this analysis focuses on sources detected by the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA). We employ an unbinned likelihood analysis to search for neutrino emission and constrain the hadronic $γ$-ray component of these sources. Neither single-source searches nor stacking analyses reveal significant neutrino signals. The stacking analysis indicates that the 1LHAASO WCDA population contributes at most $\\sim$20\\% to the diffuse GP neutrino flux measured by IceCube. The total hadronic contribution to the cumulative $γ$-ray emission from all WCDA sources is constrained to be at most $\\sim$$60\\%$, suggesting a predominantly leptonic origin for the $γ$-ray emission from the LHAASO source population. Even accounting for unresolved sources below the detection threshold, we estimate the total neutrino flux from all discrete sources (resolved plus unresolved) reaches at most about 40\\% of the observed GP neutrino flux. These results support that the bulk of the GP neutrino emission is mainly from truly diffuse processes, i.e., cosmic-ray interactions with the interstellar medium, rather than from unresolved point sources."}

If the secondary is a neutron star exceeding $2.5 M_{\\odot}$, hyperons are likely to appear in its core, softening the equation of state. Rapid rotation can offset some of this softening, enabling higher maximum masses, but it may simultaneously excite the Chandrasekhar--Friedman--Schutz $r$-mode instability. Bulk viscosity arising from nonleptonic weak interactions in hyperonic matter provides an efficient damping mechanism that can stabilize such configurations. In this work, we investigate the combined effects of rotation, thermal evolution, and hyperon-induced bulk viscosity on the stability of massive neutron stars. We demonstrate a direct connection between the suppression of $r$-mode instabilities and the long-term dynamical stability of hyperon-rich stars, offering a plausible interpretation of the GW190814 secondary as a rapidly rotating, hyperon-rich neutron star rather than a low-mass black hole. Our unified framework extends beyond previous studies restricted to static equations of state or extreme viscous damping assumptions, providing new insights into the stability of massive, exotic neutron star configurations."}

The paper is 18 pages long with 16 figures", "summary": "We present results from coordinated multiwavelength observations of the SS 433, obtained with XRISM, optical telescopes, and near-infrared camera during 2024 April and 2025 March. The XRISM exposures amounted to ~200 ks in 2024 and ~100 ks in 2025. With XRISM/Resolve's high spectral resolution and large effective area, we clearly resolved numerous emission lines even in short time segments, achieving improved accuracy in Doppler-shift measurements relative to earlier observations. The simultaneously obtained X-ray and optical Doppler shifts suggest a possible tendency for the optical emission to lag slightly behind the X-rays. In the Resolve data, the Doppler shifts of the two jet components exhibited apparent asymmetries, with jet speeds fluctuating around ~0.26$\\pm$0.01$c$ in 2024 and ~0.30$\\pm$0.01$c$ in 2025. The velocity variations indicated modulations on a timescale of ~6.3 d, with a phase offset of about -90$^{\\circ}$ relative to the nutation cycle. The observed line widths and flux of the approaching and receding jets appear consistent with the expected geometrical effects, indicating systematically larger line widths in the inner regions of the jets, as proposed by Shidatsu et al. (2025). Optical light curves show flares of ~400 s in 2024 and ~1600 s in 2025, with amplitudes up to ~15% during out-of-eclipse intervals, while the XRISM/Xtend light curves show no significant variability within the overlapping intervals and given the statistical uncertainties. Near-infrared photometry in 2024, obtained during an out-of-eclipse interval at a different epoch from the optical observations, showed no flare-like variability, and the X-ray band also remained constant within uncertainties. These coordinated observations provide a foundation for future XRISM studies aimed at probing the dynamical properties of the relativistic jets in SS 433."}
