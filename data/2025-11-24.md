*A. Uryson*

TL;DR: 分析宇宙铁核在超高能宇宙射线中的传播特性，研究其从源到地球的传播过程中的碎裂效应及能量依赖性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨超高能宇宙射线中铁核的传播机制，了解其在星系间传播过程中的碎裂行为，以及如何利用铁核能量来限制源的距离

Method: 假设超高能宇宙射线源于星系外，分析铁核在传播过程中与背景辐射的相互作用和碎裂过程，研究铁核到达地球的比例及其能量与源距离的关系

Result: 发现铁核在传播过程中会发生碎裂，其到达地球的比例和能量分布与源距离密切相关，铁核能量可用于限制其源的距离

Conclusion: 铁核在超高能宇宙射线传播中的碎裂效应显著，其能量特征可作为确定宇宙射线源距离的有效约束条件

Abstract: The propagation of cosmic iron nuclei with energies above 10^19 eV from their sources to the Galaxy is discussed by assuming that cosmic rays at ultra-high energies are of extragalactic origin. In extragalactic space, cosmic nuclei interact with background emissions and inevitably fragment. An analysis is performed of the fraction of iron nuclei reaching the Earth and how its energy depends on the distance from cosmic ray sources. It is found that energies of iron nuclei can be used to determine restriction on the distances from their sources

### [2] [How Bright in Gravitational Waves are Millisecond Pulsars for the Galactic Center GeV Gamma-Ray Excess? A Systematic Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15793)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 通过引力波探测银河系中心毫秒脉冲星群，为解释GeV伽马射线超量的脉冲星假说提供新验证方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 银河系中心GeV伽马射线超量可能是暗物质湮灭信号，也可能是毫秒脉冲星群产生的。传统电磁观测难以区分这两种解释，因此需要引力波作为补充探测手段。

Method: 系统研究可能解释GCE的MSP群体的引力波辐射，考虑三种椭圆度来源机制，建模MSP群体特性，包括孤立和双星系统中的MSP，并考虑探测中的多普勒效应。

Result: 当前干涉仪无法探测到该信号，但下一代探测器如爱因斯坦望远镜和宇宙探索者可以探测到部分MSP，为GCE的MSP解释提供新检验方法。

Conclusion: 未来对银河系中心的定向搜索将可能发现这个长期寻找的MSP群体，或对其椭圆度和丰度施加严格限制，对GCE的天体物理和暗物质解释都具有重要意义。

Abstract: The existence of dark matter (DM) is supported by various macroscopic observations, but its microscopic nature remains elusive. The Galactic Center GeV gamma-ray excess (GCE) has been a leading candidate signal for particle dark matter annihilation. However, an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the bulge provides the alternative explanation for the excess. Identifying these MSPs in electromagnetic bands is difficult due to source confusion, pulse broadening, and extinction. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a complementary probe: a steadily rotating, non-axisymmetric MSP emits a nearly monochromatic GW signal in the sensitive band of ground-based detectors, with amplitude set by its ellipticity. In this work, we systematically investigate the GW emission from the MSP population proposed to explain the GCE and its detectability with current and future detectors. We consider three major scenarios for the origin of ellipticity and model the population properties of these MSPs. We also consider both isolated MSPs and MSPs in binary systems, as well as Doppler effects in the detection. We find that while the signal is below the reach of current interferometers, next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) can detect a fraction of those MSPs, offering a novel test of the MSP interpretation of the GCE. Future directed searches toward the Galactic Center with continued improvements in sensitivities will either uncover this long-sought MSP population or place stringent limits on their ellipticities and abundance, with important implications for both the astrophysical and dark-matter interpretations of the GCE.

TL;DR: SN 2019vxm是首个被TESS在上升阶段完整观测到的IIn型超亮超新星，其早期光变曲线呈现浅于经典n=2指数的幂律上升，并与X射线暂现源GRB191117A存在时空关联，表明这是致密不对称星周介质中的激波突破现象。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究IIn型超新星的早期特征，特别是激波突破和喷流驱动的高能辐射，以理解致密星周环境中核心坍缩超新星的最早阶段物理过程。

Method: 使用TESS高时间分辨率测光数据追踪SN 2019vxm的早期上升阶段，结合X射线到近红外的多波段观测，进行光变曲线建模和X射线暂现源的时空关联分析。

Result: 首次获得IIn型超亮超新星上升阶段的完整TESS测光数据；光变曲线幂律指数n=1.41±0.04，浅于经典值；确定初光时间精度达7.2小时；发现与X射线暂现源GRB191117A的3.3σ时空关联。

Conclusion: 观测结果支持激波突破进入致密不对称星周介质的模型，表明前身星可能是从LBV向Wolf-Rayet星过渡的大质量致密恒星，周围存在团块状不对称环境。

Abstract: Shock breakout and, in some cases, jet-driven high-energy emission are increasingly recognized as key signatures of the earliest phases of core-collapse supernovae, especially in Type IIn systems due to their dense, interaction-dominated circumstellar environments. We present a comprehensive photometric analysis of SN 2019vxm, a long-duration, luminous Type IIn supernova, $M_V^{}=-21.41\pm0.05\;{\rm mag}$, observed from X-ray to near-infrared. SN 2019vxm is the first superluminous supernovae Type IIn to be caught with well-sampled TESS photometric data on the rise and has a convincing coincident X-ray source at the time of first light. The high-cadence TESS light curve captures the early-time rise, which is well described by a broken power law with an index of $n=1.41\pm0.04$, significantly shallower than the canonical $n=2$ behavior. From this, we constrain the time of first light to within 7.2 hours. We identify a spatial and temporal coincidence between SN 2019vxm and the X-ray transient GRB191117A, corresponding to a $3.3σ$ association confidence. Both the short-duration X-ray event and the lightcurve modeling are consistent with shock breakout into a dense, asymmetric circumstellar medium, indicative of a massive, compact progenitor such as a luminous blue variable transitioning to Wolf-Rayet phase embedded in a clumpy, asymmetric environment.

TL;DR: 对SDSS类星体中具有多个Gaia探测的候选系统进行VLBI高分辨率成像研究，通过结合Gaia和VLBI的精确天体测量，澄清这些系统的真实性质并排除双活动星系核候选样本中的污染源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究发现SDSS类星体中存在多个Gaia探测的候选系统，可能包括类星体-恒星对、双类星体和引力透镜类星体等，需要高分辨率观测来精确分类这些系统。

Method: 将SQUAB类星体样本与FIRST和NVSS射电星表交叉匹配，选择18个射电发射源中最亮的3个进行双频(1.6和4.9 GHz)VLBA观测，在Gaia两个位置进行VLBI成像，构建谱指数图并估算亮度温度。

Result: 对三个目标源的VLBI观测显示，在主要Gaia位置存在与单个活动星系核一致的致密射电结构，在次要Gaia位置未检测到显著发射，支持这些源为类星体-恒星对的解释。

Conclusion: 这项试点研究证明了射电VLBI高分辨率后续观测对Gaia选出的多对应体类星体系统的价值，能够明确揭示这些系统的真实性质，并帮助从双活动星系核候选样本中去除污染源。

Abstract: Our previous work identified a class of SDSS quasars exhibiting multiple Gaia detections, classifying them as candidates for various astrophysical systems such as quasar-star pairs, dual quasars, and gravitationally lensed quasars. In this paper, we present a pilot VLBI study targeting a radio-bright subsample and report the first high-resolution imaging results. By leveraging the milliarcsecond-scale resolution of VLBI and its precise astrometric coordination incorporating with Gaia, we aim to refine the classification of these multiple matched sources, search for potential dual AGNs, and assess the efficacy of the combined Gaia-VLBI approach in resolving ambiguous quasar systems. We cross-matched the SQUAB quasar sample with the FIRST and NVSS catalogs, identifying 18 radio-emitting sources. The three brightest were selected for dual-frequency (1.6 and 4.9 GHz) VLBA observations. We performed VLBI imaging at both Gaia positions, constructed spectral index maps, and estimated brightness temperatures to characterize the radio morphology and physical properties. For the three target sources, our VLBI observations reveal compact radio structures consistent with single AGN at the primary Gaia positions. No significant emission is detected at the secondary Gaia locations. These results support the interpretation of the sources as quasar$-$star pairs, in line with earlier studies. This pilot study demonstrates the value of radio-VLBI high-resolution follow-ups on Gaia-selected quasar systems with multiple counterparts, showing how they can unambiguously reveal the true nature of these systems and help remove contaminants from dual AGN candidate samples.

### [5] [Constraining the Corona Geometry of Cyg X-1 with Broad Band Spectrum and Polarimetric Analysis Based on Observations in May 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16246)

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 通过重新分析Cygnus X-1在2022年低硬态时的IXPE、NuSTAR和NICER数据，发现双康普顿化组分模型比单组分模型更符合观测。降低盘光子温度至约0.15 keV可增加偏振度约2个百分点，但仍低于观测值。研究支持硬康普顿化组分具有夹层板状几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释IXPE观测到的Cygnus X-1偏振度比理论预期高约4倍的现象，并探究其高偏振度的物理机制。

Method: 使用IXPE、NuSTAR和NICER数据进行联合分析，研究光谱的时间变异性，比较单/双康普顿化组分模型，并通过详细模拟研究不同几何结构（板状、楔形）对偏振的影响。

Result: 发现双康普顿化组分模型能更好地再现数据，盘光子温度约为0.15 keV。模拟显示降低盘温度可使偏振度增加约2个百分点，但模拟值仍显著低于观测值。板状几何结构预测的偏振特性与观测一致。

Conclusion: Cygnus X-1在2022年5月表现出具有不同光学深度的双康普顿化冕辐射，其中硬组分具有夹层板状几何结构。偏振度受黑洞和冕的其他参数影响。

Abstract: Cygnus X-1 (Cyg X-1) exhibited a low hard state in 2022, observed by several missions. The IXPE reported that the polarization angle is aligned with the radio jet and gave a polarization degree approximately 4 times higher than the general expectations of $1\%$ through the analysis of the time-integrated data with a simple spectral model, indicating that the disk inclination is higher than a canonical value of about $30^{\circ}$. Many subsequent theoretical studies employed a non-standard model to explain this high PD. Here, we revisit the disk/corona spectrum through a detailed joint analysis using IXPE, NuSTAR, and NICER data. By investigating the time variability of the spectrum, we find that the two-Comptonization components model can better reproduce the data than the one-Comptonization component model originally adopted. We observed a lower disk photon temperature of about 0.15 keV. Detailed simulation suggests that lowering the disk temperature by a factor of 2 increases the PD by roughly 2 percentage points in the IXPE 2--8 keV band for a slab-like corona geometry, helping to reconcile the observed high PD with theoretical predictions. However, The simulated PDs are still significantly lower than the observed ones - even for a rather high $60^{\circ}$ inclination. We also investigated the polarization properties of a simple wedge-shaped corona with a truncated disk and a sandwiching slab corona. We find that the slab corona predicts an apparent energy dependence in PD while PA remains constant in the IXPE band, in agreement with the observed polarization. Therefore, we suggest that Cyg X-1 in 2022 May exhibits a two-Comptonization coronal emission with different optical depths, and the hard one is in a sandwiching slab geometry. We also discuss how the polarization is affected by other parameters of the black hole and the corona.

Abstract: Analogous to the HR diagram for stars, the thermal equilibrium curve encodes the thermodynamics of accretion disks by expressing the local balance between heating -- primarily via viscous dissipation -- and cooling -- typically through radiative transfer. These curves are commonly plotted as surface density versus effective temperature. When an S-shaped locus appears, local annuli become bistable, and limit-cycle oscillations arise when the external mass-transfer rate falls within an unstable band. This behavior underpins the disk instability model for recurring outbursts in cataclysmic variables. This paper reviews first-principles thermal equilibrium curves for accretion disks driven by magnetorotational instability (MRI), with emphasis on dwarf novae. Unlike the parameterized $α$-viscosity approach, the curves are obtained by solving the governing equations with radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations, thereby reproducing S-shaped loci without prescribing $α$. The disk instability in dwarf-nova systems and the physical origin of angular-momentum transport (shear stresses) are also briefly reviewed. Notes on the stability of radiation-dominated accretion flows are included in the Appendix.

Abstract: Transient Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are usually first detected by all-sky X-ray monitors when they enter new outbursts, typically at X-ray luminosities above $\sim$10$^{36}$ erg/s. Observations of these sources during the early rise of the outbursts have so far been very limited. However, the launch of the Einstein Probe (EP) has greatly improved our ability to detect fainter X-ray activity, unlocking access to the outburst early rise. In September 2024, EP detected the early onset of a new outburst from the neutron star LMXB Aql X-1, catching the source at a luminosity below 10$^{35}$ erg/s. In this paper we present results from a comprehensive, multi-wavelength campaign of this event, combining data from EP, NICER, NuSTAR, Swift and Las Cumbres Observatory covering the full outburst from its early rise through its decay. By comparing X-ray and optical light curves obtained with Las Cumbres Observatory during the initial rise, we show that the start of the X-ray emission lagged the optical rise by, at most, 3 days. Time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy revealed how the geometry and the physical properties of the accretion flow evolve during this early stage of the outburst, as well as at higher luminosities as the source transitioned through the canonical X-ray spectral states - hard, intermediate and soft. These data show that the source underwent a very rapid, about 12-h long, transition from the hard to the soft state about two weeks after the optical onset of the outburst. The evolution of the temperature and physical sizes of both the inner region of the disk and a black body near the NS surface suggest that at the state transition, a boundary and spreading layer likely formed. We discuss these results in the context of time-scales for outburst evolution and state transitions in accreting neutron stars and black holes.

Abstract: Observed metal abundances in the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy groups and clusters, $Z_{ICM}$, exceed what is expected from present-day stellar populations alone. Galaxy clusters are presumed to be near closed-box systems, allowing constraints to be placed on the origins of metals and stellar populations responsible for $Z_{ICM}$. We present a uniform XMM-Newton survey of 26 galaxy groups and clusters, measuring radial metallicity profiles and relating $Z_{ICM}$ with the stellar fraction $M_*/M_{gas}$. We determine $Z_{ICM}$ via spectral fitting across multiple annuli finding a best fit of $Z_{ICM} = -0.08^{+0.07}_{-0.07}\, log\left(\frac{M_*}{M_{gas}}\right) + 0.30^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ with intrinsic scatter $σ_p = 0.09^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$. We use closed-box chemical evolution models to estimate the metallicity yield from observable stellar populations, incorporating updated supernova yields and corrections for metals locked in remnants, $Z_* = (1.14 \pm 0.52) \, log\left(1 + \frac{M_*}{M_{gas}}\right)$. Our results demonstrate that present-day stellar populations systematically underpredict $Z_{ICM}$, with an inferred excess component increasing in systems with low $M_*/M_{gas}$. This trend supports the need for an early enrichment population (EEP) distinct from visible stars, $Z_{EEP}$. We find this necessity holds when reconsidering the closed-box assumption by removing all galaxy groups, potential leaky systems, deriving $Z_{EEP}$ within $1σ$ when including and excluding groups. Three systems (NGC1132, NGC5098, and NGC4325) deviate from the survey trend, exhibiting steep negative radial metallicity gradients and unusually low $Z_{ICM}$. We posit these systems to be late-forming whose ICM enrichment reflects only recent stellar populations. Our analysis quantifies the necessity of an EEP and provides trends for testing cluster chemical evolution models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集天体物理环境中的中微子味演化本质上是非线性的，对超越平均场近似的多体量子效应敏感。现有研究受限于小系统尺寸、封闭边界和高度理想化的对称性假设。

Method: 开发了统一的张量网络框架，模拟非均匀和各向异性味演化，比较了不同边界条件和初始配置下的系统行为。

Result: 多体系统比平均场系统更早达到平衡，但趋向相似的最终味态。扩大相互作用区域可使开放边界重现封闭系统行为，但仅限于初始叠加且持续相互作用的情况。初始分离的配置发展纠缠更慢，相互作用时间更长，平衡后的味含量与初始叠加计算不同。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究核心坍缩超新星和中子星合并相关条件下的中微子味演化提供了新工具，揭示了初始条件和边界效应对多体量子动力学的重要影响。

Abstract: Neutrino flavor evolution in dense astrophysical environments is inherently nonlinear and sensitive to many-body (MB) quantum effects beyond the mean-field (MF) approximation. Existing MB studies are constrained by small system sizes, closed boundaries, and highly idealized symmetry assumptions. We present a unified tensor-network framework that enables simulations of inhomogeneous and anisotropic flavor evolution under conditions relevant to core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers. Within this framework, we examine the effects of inhomogeneity, boundary conditions, and convergence with resolution for multiple neutrino distributions, allowing direct comparison of these setups under one consistent formulation. In our simulations, many-body systems equilibrate earlier than their mean-field counterparts while approaching similar final flavor states. Enlarging the interaction region allows open boundaries to reproduce closed-system behavior, but only when the beams begin superimposed and interact continuously. By contrast, initially separated configurations develop entanglement more slowly, interact over longer times, and equilibrate to a flavor content that differs from that obtained from initially superimposed calculations.

TL;DR: 中子星被动冷却应在10^7年内降至不可探测的表面温度，但观测显示Gyr级毫秒脉冲星和10^7-8年经典脉冲星仍保持约10^5 K热辐射，需要加热机制解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为什么老中子星仍保持可观测的热辐射，探索可能的加热机制。

Method: 计算中子星热演化，包括核心旋转化学加热（正常或库珀配对物质）、内壳层涡旋蠕变和壳层核反应加热，并与观测数据比较。

Result: 单一机制无法解释所有源。PSR J0437-4715的高温需要大库珀配对间隙的旋转化学加热，但PSR B0950+08需要不现实的短初始周期。结合大配对间隙旋转化学加热和涡旋蠕变的模型能匹配两个脉冲星，并与其他三个的上限一致。

Conclusion: 旋转化学加热与涡旋蠕变结合是解释观测数据的最合理机制，预测其他脉冲星温度接近观测上限，未来更深入观测可验证此模型。

Abstract: Passively cooling neutron stars (NSs) should reach undetectably low surface temperatures $T_s<10^4$ K in less than $10^7$ yr. However, HST observations have revealed likely thermal UV emission from the Gyr-old millisecond pulsars PSR~J0437$-$4715 and PSR~J2124$-$3358, and from the $\sim10^{7-8}$ yr-old classical pulsars PSR~B0950$+$08 and PSR~J0108$-$1431, implying $T_s\sim10^5$ K and the need for heating mechanisms. We compute the thermal evolution of these NSs including rotochemical heating (RH) in the core with normal or Cooper-paired matter, vortex creep (VC) in the inner crust, and crustal heating through nuclear reactions, and compare the results with observations and with the upper limit for PSR~2144$-$3933. No single mechanism explains all sources. The high temperature of PSR~J0437$-$4715 can be reproduced by RH with a large Cooper pairing gap $Δ_i\sim1.5$ MeV for either neutrons or protons, but this requires an unrealistically short initial period $P_0\lesssim1.8$ ms to activate the same mechanism in PSR~B0950$+$08. Conversely, the latter can be explained by RH with modified Urca reactions in normal matter or by VC with an excess angular momentum $J\sim3\times10^{43}$ erg,s, but these models underpredict PSR~J0437$-$4715. A model combining RH with a large pairing gap and VC matches both pulsars and is consistent with the upper limits for the remaining three. It further predicts that their temperatures should lie close to these limits, suggesting that deeper or broader-wavelength observations would provide a strong test of this scenario.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的超新星中微子能谱参数化方法，通过特征热扩散面积参数τ(t)来量化爆炸过程，该参数能区分成功与失败的爆炸，并与引力波应变振幅协同演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个具有明确物理动机的参数化方法，用于描述超新星中微子能谱，以更好地理解核心坍缩超新星的爆炸机制和多信使过程。

Method: 引入基于特征热扩散面积τ(t)的参数化方法，应用于SN1987A历史数据，并使用平滑保序回归约束前身星质量，同时在3D核心坍缩超新星模拟中验证模型。

Result: 该参数化方法在SN1987A数据中产生统计显著拟合，能可靠约束未观测到的低能谱部分；τ(t)的时间演化能清晰区分成功与失败的爆炸；约束SN1987A前身星质量约为19太阳质量；τ(t)与引力波应变振幅显示强协同演化。

Conclusion: 该框架为解码未来银河系超新星的详细核心动力学和多信使过程提供了有价值的工具，表明爆炸的热力学状态不仅印刻在逃逸中微子通量上，也记录在能谱形状中。

Abstract: We introduce a novel parameterization of supernova neutrino energy spectra with a clear physical motivation. Its central parameter, $τ(t)$, quantifies the characteristic thermal-diffusion area during the explosion. When applied to the historic SN1987A data, this parameterization yields statistically significant fits and provides robust constraints on the unobserved low-energy portion of the spectrum. Beyond this specific application, we demonstrate the model's power on a suite of 3D core-collapse supernova simulations, finding that the temporal evolution of $τ(t)$ distinctly separates successful from failed explosions. Furthermore, we constrain the progenitor mass of SN 1987A to approximately 19 solar masses by applying Smoothed Isotonic Regression, while noting the sensitivity of this estimate to observational uncertainties. Moreover, in these simulations, $τ(t)$ and the gravitational-wave strain amplitude display a strong, synergistic co-evolution, directly linking the engine's energetic evolution to its geometric asymmetry. This implies that the thermodynamic state of the explosion is imprinted not only on the escaping neutrino flux, but also recorded in the shape of the energy spectrum. Our framework therefore offers a valuable tool for decoding the detailed core dynamics and multi-messenger processes of future galactic supernovae.

Motivation: GW190814的不对称性（质量比约1/10）使其天体物理起源难以解释，作者旨在通过孤立二进制演化模型探索其形成机制。

Method: 使用COSMIC二进制种群合成代码和backpop采样技术，将GW190814的观测参数映射到零龄主序双星的初始条件，同时推断形成所需的共同包层演化、稳定质量转移和natal kick运动学等天体物理机制。

Result: 发现GW190814的初始条件与本地星系群观测的大质量星群无明显差异；主导形成路径包括共同包层演化的第一次洛希瓣溢出和稳定的第二次洛希瓣溢出；natal kicks对形成此类系统起决定性作用。

Conclusion: natal kicks的方向和强度是形成GW190814类系统的关键因素，特别是第二次natal kick的方向需在轨道平面内指向质心，以增加轨道偏心率并缩短延迟时间，使系统能在哈勃时间内合并。

Abstract: The asymmetric nature of GW190814, particularly its mass ratio ($q \approx 1/10$), has made its astrophysical origin elusive. We explore isolated binary evolution as a potential explanation for GW190814's formation. Using the binary population synthesis code COSMIC, and the backpop sampling technique to map the observed parameters of GW190814 to the initial conditions of Zero Age Main Sequence binary stars while simultaneously inferring the astrophysical prescriptions for common envelope evolution, stable mass transfer and natal kick kinematics that are needed for its formation and eventual merger. We find that the initial conditions for the binary stellar population that forms GW190814 do not stand out significantly from massive star populations observed in the Local Group. Our backpop simulations recover a dominant formation pathway where the first Roche overflow phase includes a common envelope evolution and the second Roche overflow phase remains stable. Our findings suggest that natal kicks imparted during compact object formation play the strongest role in forming GW190814-like systems. Specifically, our models require a low magnitude first natal kick (independent of direction) that prevents the binary from unbinding and a large second natal kick with its direction in the plane of the orbit and toward the binary's center of mass. The second natal kick strength and direction crucially increases the orbital eccentricity, leading to shorter delay times, and thus enabling mergers within a Hubble time. We estimate the chance probability for GW190814-like events that experience such a lucky kick and find that it occurs in $\sim20\%$ of systems if natal kicks are randomly oriented. We discuss the astrophysical implications for the formation of asymmetric GW190814-like systems under the context of binary stellar evolution.
