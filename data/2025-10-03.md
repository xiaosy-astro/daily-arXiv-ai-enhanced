Abstract: Interpreting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of astrophysical
objects with physically motivated models is computationally expensive. These
models require solving coupled differential equations in high-dimensional
parameter spaces, making traditional fitting techniques such as Markov Chain
Monte Carlo or nested sampling prohibitive. A key example is modeling
non-thermal emission from blazar jets - relativistic outflows from supermassive
black holes in Active Galactic Nuclei that are among the most powerful emitters
in the Universe. To address this challenge, we employ machine learning to
accelerate SED evaluations, enabling efficient Bayesian inference. We generate
a large sample of lepto-hadronic blazar emission models and train a neural
network (NN) to predict the photon spectrum with strongly reduced run time
while preserving accuracy. As a proof of concept, we present an NN-based tool
for blazar SED modeling, laying the groundwork for future extensions and for
providing an open-access resource for the astrophysics community.

TL;DR: 这项研究分析了超新星SN 2025coe的光变曲线和光谱演化，发现其具有三个明显峰值，并通过建模得出其喷射质量、镍质量和前身星包层特征，认为低质量CO白矮星与混合HeCO白矮星的潮汐破坏解释了其特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是通过多波段观测和建模，探讨超新星SN 2025coe的前身星性质及其爆炸机制，尤其关注其高[Ca II]/[O I]比值和低质量喷射物的特性。

Method: 使用光谱和光变曲线数据，结合多波段观测（约100天跟踪），并通过光度曲线建模确定喷射质量、镍质量及包层参数。

Result: 发现SN 2025coe的光变曲线有三个明显峰值，分别由激波冷却、放射性衰变和喷射物与星周物质相互作用引起；模型显示喷射质量为0.29±0.15 M⊙，镍质量为2.4×10⁻² M⊙，且包层质量与半径的参数存在较大不确定性。

Conclusion: 潮汐破坏混合HeCO白矮星与低质量CO白矮星的相互作用提供了解释SN 2025coe低喷射质量、少量镍和扩展低质量包层的自然机制，这为不同类型白矮星相互作用导致的超新星爆发提供了新思路。

Abstract: SN 2025coe is a calcium-strong transient located at an extremely large
projected offset $\sim$39.3 kpc from the center of its host, the nearby
early-type galaxy NGC 3277 at a distance of $\sim$25.5 Mpc. In this paper, we
present multi-band photometric and spectroscopic observations spanning
$\sim$100 days post-discovery. Its multi-band light curves display three
distinct peaks: (1) an initial peak at $t \approx 1.6$ days attributed to shock
cooling emission, (2) a secondary peak of $M_{R, \, peak} \approx$ $-$15.8 mag
at $t \approx 10.2$ days powered by radioactive decay, and (3) a late-time bump
at $t \approx 42.8$ days likely caused by ejecta-circumstellar material/clump
interaction. Spectral evolution of SN 2025coe reveals a fast transition to the
nebular phase within 2 months, where it exhibits an exceptionally high [Ca
II]/[O I] ratio larger than 6. Modeling of the bolometric light curve suggests
an ejecta mass of $M_{\rm ej} = 0.29^{+0.14}_{-0.15} \, M_{\odot}$, a $^{56}$Ni
mass of $M_{\rm ^{56}Ni} = 2.4^{+0.06}_{-0.05} \times 10^{-2} M_{\odot}$, and a
progenitor envelope with mass $M_e = 1.4^{+6.9}_{-1.2} \times 10^{-3} \,
M_{\odot}$ and radius $R_e = 13.5^{+64.1}_{-11.1} \, R_{\odot}$. The tidal
disruption of a hybrid HeCO white dwarf (WD) by a low-mass CO WD provides a
natural explanation for the low ejecta mass, the small fraction of $^{56}$Ni,
and the presence of an extended, low-mass envelope.

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are cosmic events occurring at large distances beyond
our galaxy. They provide a unique opportunity to study electromagnetic patterns
not seen elsewhere. When the collimated GRB outflow interacts with the outer
layers of a star or the wind generated by a binary neutron star merger, it
releases energy, forming a quasi-spherical outflow around it. This broad
outflow begins to radiate once it has transferred enough energy to the
surrounding medium. We have developed a new analytical model that describes the
synchrotron afterglow scenario of the quasi-spherical outflow, including
factors such as stratified density, self-absorption regime, and the fraction of
electrons accelerated by the shock front. We also successfully describe the
multiwavelength observations of a sample of llGRB afterglows (GRB 980425,
031203, 060218, 100316D, 130603B, 150101B and 171205A) that exhibited a late
component, analyzed in both stellar wind and constant-density environments. Our
analysis shows that a constant-density environment is favored. Additionally, we
consider the multiwavelength upper limits of the short bursts reported in the
Swift-BAT database.

TL;DR: The paper investigates exotic astrophysical sources that can produce ultra-high-energy gamma rays beyond the PeV scale, exploring their potential as PeVatrons and detectability by observatories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from quantum gravity scenarios and dark matter phenomenology, aiming to understand high-energy astrophysical phenomena beyond conventional models.

Method: The authors analyze interactions between exotic sources and millicharged dark matter to generate powerful magnetic fields, enabling particle acceleration mechanisms.

Result: Exotic PeVatrons, such as ultra-spinning black holes and compact objects like boson stars, could be distributed in the Galaxy and may be detectable by existing and next-generation observatories.

Conclusion: These exotic sources offer new possibilities for producing ultra-high-energy gamma rays and could be observed with current and future gamma-ray telescopes.

Abstract: We explore novel classes of exotic astrophysical sources capable of producing
ultra-high-energy gamma rays extending beyond the PeV scale, motivated by
quantum gravity scenarios and dark matter phenomenology. These sources include:
ultra-spinning black hole vortex-string systems; exotic compact objects such as
boson star, axion star and Q-ball. Such Exotica generate powerful magnetic
fields through interactions with millicharged dark matter, enabling particle
acceleration mechanisms that surpass the energy limits of conventional
astrophysical sources like pulsar wind nebulae and supernova remnants. We
demonstrate that such exotic PeVatrons could be distributed throughout our
Galaxy and may be detectable by current (LHAASO, HAWC) and next-generation
(CTA) gamma-ray observatories.

TL;DR: 研究通过二维粒子-在-细胞（PIC）模拟，分析了相对论性冲击波中电子-正电子等离子体与质子混合物的粒子加速现象，发现正电子加速到与质子相当的能量，并形成硬非热成分谱，而电子被限制在较低能量，这种不对称性归因于质子驱动的电磁波的极化特性。

Motivation: 了解相对论性冲击波中粒子加速机制，特别是在混合等离子体中的行为，这对解释天体物理源中的非热辐射和能量分布有重要意义。

Method: 采用二维粒子-在-细胞（PIC）模拟方法，模拟相对论性垂直冲击波在含有5%质子的等离子体中的形成，分析冲击结构、电磁场和粒子能谱。

Result: 正电子在远下游区域被加速到与质子相当的能量，形成硬非热成分谱（谱指数约为2），而电子保持在较低能量。

Conclusion: 该研究显示，在电子-正电子等离子体中引入质子能显著改变粒子加速特性，强调了等离子体成分在塑造相对论冲击中非热发射和粒子加速的重要性。

Abstract: Particle acceleration in relativistic shocks of electron-positron plasmas
with proton admixture is investigated through two-dimensional (2D)
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. The upstream plasma, with a bulk Lorentz
factor of $10$ and a magnetization parameter of 0.02, includes a small fraction
of protons ($\sim 5\%$ by number). A relativistic perpendicular shock is formed
by reflecting the flow off a conducting wall. The shock structure,
electromagnetic fields, and particle energy spectra are analyzed. The particle
density and the magnetic field have fluctuations. In the far-downstream region
of the shock, positrons are accelerated to energies comparable to protons and
develop a hard nonthermal component with a spectral index of $\sim 2$ in their
energy spectrum, while electrons remain confined to lower energies. This
asymmetry is attributed to the polarization properties of proton-driven
electromagnetic waves, which favor positron acceleration. The results highlight
the importance of plasma composition in shaping particle acceleration and
nonthermal emission in relativistic shocks. These findings provide new insights
into the microphysics of particle acceleration in astrophysical sources
containing relativistic shocks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Blazars are active galactic nuclei known for their extreme variability,
offering unique opportunities to study jet physics and high-energy emission
mechanisms. In 2024, the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) OP313 underwent a
remarkable flare event, during which the gamma-ray flux observed by the Fermi
Large Area Telescope (Fermi/LAT) increased by a factor of 60 over its average
value. The flare peak lasted less than two days. Using optical telescopes, we
conducted 100-day time-scale observations. Multi-wavelength data revealed that
OP313 entered an active state 50 days prior to the flare and remained active
for at least 50 days afterward. We propose that this prolonged activity results
from variations in electron density within the shock front due to changes in
the accretion rate. Concurrently, OP313's spectrum transitioned from an
FSRQ-like state to a BL Lac-like state, characterized by a significant increase
in the synchrotron peak frequency and the disappearance of broad-line region
emission lines. In the post-flare phase, we observed a decoupling between
synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering, along with a possible
decrease in the magnetic field strength within the shock front.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了非喷流活动星系核（AGN）的硬X射线发射机制，提出通过相对论性质子在黑洞磁层电流片中的加速过程产生中微子的新模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型认为AGN的硬X射线是由电子和正电子对的康普顿化过程产生，但其起源和组成仍有争议。

Method: 构建了两个自由参数的模型（质子等离子体磁化率σ_p和爱丁顿比λ_Edd），并结合AGN群体模型预测地球上的扩散中微子通量。

Result: 模型结果与IceCube观测数据在通量值和中微子分布的斜率上表现出满意的一致性，特别是在假设所有样本源的σ_p值为10^5时。

Conclusion: 相对论性质子在AGN的磁层电流片中可能在中微子产生中起关键作用，这为研究AGN的高能辐射机制提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Non-jetted AGN exhibit hard X-ray emission with a power law spectrum above
$\sim$2 keV, which is thought to be produced through Comptonization of soft
photons by electrons and positrons (pairs) in the vicinity of the black hole.
The origin and composition of this plasma source, known as the corona, is a
matter open for debate. Our study focuses on the role of relativistic protons
accelerated in black-hole magnetospheric current sheets in the neutrino
production of AGN coronae. We present a model that has two free parameters,
namely the proton plasma magnetization $\sigma_{\rm p}$, which controls the
peak energy of the neutrino spectrum, and the Eddington ratio $\lambda_{\rm
Edd}$ (defined as the ratio between X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and Eddington
luminosity $L_{\rm Edd}$), which controls the amount of energy transferred to
secondary particles. Furthermore, we combine our coronal model with an AGN
population in order to provide a prediction for the diffuse neutrino flux
measured on Earth. We compare our results with the observational data by
IceCube and we find a satisfactory agreement on both the flux value and the
slope of the neutrino distribution when we assume a $\sigma_{\rm p}$ value of
$10^5$ for all the sources in our sample.

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the universe,
offering insights into stellar collapse, extreme matter behavior, and cosmic
evolution. The advent of multi-messenger astronomy, combining electromagnetic,
gravitational wave, and neutrino observations, alongside advances in
high-energy polarimetry, is revolutionizing GRB research, enabling deeper

  This manuscript summarizes how upcoming and proposed space-based missions
will tackle key challenges in GRB science, focusing on four areas: (i)
identifying high-redshift GRBs to probe the early universe, (ii) enhancing
multi-messenger detection and localization, (iii) improving multi-wavelength
follow-up of GRB afterglows, and (iv) studying prompt emission polarization to
understand jet dynamics and magnetic fields. Highlighting planned missions and
their advancements, this work provides a snapshot of current GRB research
frontiers, with updates on the evolving status of these missions.

### [9] [Dissecting the radiation mechanism of short GRB~160821B through multi-wavelength modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00780)
*Ankur Ghosh,Monica Barnard,Jagdish C. Joshi,Soebur Razzaque*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: GRB 160821B 是唯一在甚高能 (VHE) 范围内检测到的短伽马射线暴 (GRB)，其红移为 0.161，发生在一个高密度风介质中，且在 CTA 时代未来的更多 VHE 检测可能提供关于短 GRB 机制的重要见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于之前的短 GRB VHE 发射研究缺乏系统的统计分析，该研究旨在通过结合同步辐射、SSC 和 EC 模型，利用 MCMC 技术对 GRB 160821B 的后随辐射进行建模，以更好地理解其辐射机制和粒子加速过程。

Method: 综合同步辐射、同步辐射自康普顿 (SSC) 和外部康普顿 (EC) 模型，结合 MCMC 方法对 GRB 160821B 在 1.7 到 4 小时时间尺度上的多波段数据进行拟合，并将其与其他 VHE GRB 的属性进行比较。

Result: 研究发现 EC 贡献与 SSC 相比微不足道，且该模型能良好解释风介质中的 VHE 数据。GRB 160821B 是迄今最弱的 VHE GRB，其高密度风介质对于短 GRB 来说非常罕见，且表明其发生于低磁化环境中。

Conclusion: GRB 160821B 在 $E_{k, m iso}$ - $eta$ 参数空间中显著区别于其他 VHE GRB，且超出 3-$m eta$ 相关的 3-$m eta$ 区域。未来的 CTA 时代的 VHE 短 GRB 检测将为辐射机制、粒子加速和其与长 GRB 的联系提供关键技术洞察。

Abstract: GRB~160821B is the only short GRB detected to date at very high energy (VHE,
$\gtrsim 100$ GeV). At a redshift $z=0.161$, it was detected by MAGIC
telescopes approximately four hours since the trigger. VHE dataset was complied
with the datasets of other wavelengths in between the timescale of 1.7 to 4
hours to construct the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). In
previous studies of GRB~160821B, synchrotron and external Compton (EC) model
could explain the VHE emission better than the synchrotron and synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) model. Although, these fits were mostly eyeballing data
without any optimisation. Our model includes the combination of synchrotron,
SSC, and EC models with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Our
analysis reveals that the EC contribution is negligible in comparison with the
SSC and our model explains the VHE data well for the wind medium. We found that
GRB~160821B is the least energetic VHE GRB and it occurred in high density wind
medium which is quiet unusual for a short GRB. But like other long-duration VHE
GRBs, GRB~160821B occurred in a poorly magnetised medium. As there is no
statistical study on afterglow modelling of short GRB sample, we compare the
inferred properties of GRB~160821B with other VHE GRBs. It stands out
distinctively in the $E_{k, \rm iso}$ - $\epsilon_B$ parameter space and lies
outside the 3-$\sigma$ region of the correlation. In future, more VHE
detections of short GRBs, in the CTA era, will provide crucial insights into
the emission sites, radiation mechanisms, and particle acceleration, as well as
their connection to long GRBs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the evolution of the black hole's spin parameter in XTE J1550-564 helps in elucidating the complex dynamics of X-ray binaries and the challenges in modeling their observed properties.

Method: The authors used a set of models with various parameter combinations to replicate the system's observed characteristics, including component masses, orbital period, donor luminosity, and effective temperature. They also explored alternative magnetic braking prescriptions.

Result: The models indicate diverse evolutionary pathways, with the initial mass of the donor star and mass transfer efficiency being significant factors. Only an extreme and fully conservative magnetic braking scenario could marginally reproduce the observed moderate spin.

Conclusion: The study highlights the difficulty in explaining the observed moderate spin of the black hole in XTE J1550-564 with current theoretical models, suggesting the need for further research into magnetic braking mechanisms.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the X-ray binary system XTE~J1550-564,
with the primary objective of analyzing the evolution of the black hole's spin
parameter. To achieve this objective, we embarked on the necessary step of
identifying a plausible progenitor for the system. Using a set of models
covering various parameter combinations, we were able to replicate the system's
observed characteristics within acceptable error margins, including fundamental
parameters such as component masses, orbital period, donor luminosity, and
effective temperature. The model results indicate the possibility of diverse
evolutionary pathways for the system, highlighting the significant role played
by the initial mass of the donor star and the efficiency of mass transfer
episodes. While some models are well-aligned with estimates of the mass
transfer rate, they all fall short of explaining the black hole's observed
moderate spin ($a^* = 0.49$). We also explored alternative magnetic braking
prescriptions, finding that only an extreme and fully conservative scenario,
based on the convection and rotation boosted prescription, can reproduce the
observed spin and only in a marginal way. Our study attempts to shed light on
the complex dynamics of black hole X-ray binaries and the challenges of
explaining their observed properties with theoretical models.

Abstract: Pulsars are spinning neutron stars typically observed as pulses emitted at
radio wavelengths. These pulsations exhibit a rotational stability that rival
the best atomic clocks, making pulsars one of the most important tools for
resolving gravitational phenomena in extreme environments. I will present an
overview of the ways in which radio pulsars can be used to test strong-field
gravity and observe gravitational radiation, both in the context of historical
and ongoing experiments. I will also describe how these measurements can be
translated to sought-after quantities like the masses and moments of inertia of
neutron stars.

Abstract: Kilonovae are the scientifically rich, but observationally elusive, optical
transient phenomena associated with compact binary mergers. Only a handful of
events have been discovered to date, all through multi-wavelength (gamma ray)
and multi-messenger (gravitational wave) signals. Given their scarcity, it is
important to maximise the discovery possibility of new kilonova events. To this
end, we present our follow-up observations of the gravitational-wave signal,
S250818k, a plausible binary neutron star merger at a distance of $237 \pm 62$
Mpc. Pan-STARRS tiled 286 and 318 square degrees (32% and 34% of the 90% sky
localisation region) within 3 and 7 days of the GW signal, respectively. ATLAS
covered 70% of the skymap within 3 days, but with lower sensitivity. These
observations uncovered 47 new transients; however, none were deemed to be
linked to S250818k. We undertook an expansive follow-up campaign of AT 2025ulz,
the purported counterpart to S250818k. The griz-band lightcurve, combined with
our redshift measurement ($z = 0.0849 \pm 0.0003$) all indicate that SN 2025ulz
is a SN IIb, and thus not the counterpart to S250818k. We rule out the presence
of a AT 2017gfo-like kilonova within $\approx 27$% of the distance posterior
sampled by our Pan-STARRS pointings ($\approx 9.1$% across the total 90%
three-dimensional sky localisation). We demonstrate that early observations are
optimal for probing the distance posterior of the three-dimensional
gravitational-wave skymap, and that SN 2025ulz was a plausible kilonova
candidate for $\lesssim 5$ days, before ultimately being ruled out.

Abstract: The magnification resulting from strong gravitational lensing is a powerful
tool to add new constraints to the cosmic evolution of supernova progenitors by
enabling the study of distant supernovae that would otherwise not be
observable. iPTF16geu is the most well-observed gravitationally lensed
supernova (glSN) to date. At a redshift of $z = 0.409$ and magnified by a
factor of $\sim$68, extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations have
been obtained. The explosion mechanism producing this rare event and
differences compared to lower redshift supernovae however have not been
explored in detail. Here we compare observations of iPTF16geu to existing
radiative transfer simulations of type Ia supernova explosion models selected
from the literature. We find that overall the DDC6 and PDDEL1 models, specific
variations of the delayed detonation explosion scenario, produce the closest
match to the light curves and many absorption features, but struggle to
replicate the observed colours and in particular the rest-frame UV. We also
investigate the magnification and reddening values required to improve
agreement with the selected models. We find some evidence in favour of a UV
flux excess that may be intrinsic to iPTF16geu or due to external factors such
as host galaxy subtraction and uncertainties in the reddening law. Upcoming
surveys will significantly increase the samples of SNe discovered at high
redshifts due to strong gravitational lensing. These glSNe will enable tighter
constraints on the explosion physics of type Ia supernovae and how this has
evolved throughout the Universe.

Abstract: The diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) created by stellar
core-collapses throughout cosmic history is on the verge of discovery, with
SK-Gd showing early deviations from the background expectation and JUNO
starting to take data. However, the interpretation of early DSNB data will face
significant challenges due to degeneracies between astrophysical parameters and
uncertainties in supernova neutrino modeling. We explore how complementary
astronomical observations can break these degeneracies and, in this context, we
investigate whether early DSNB observations can constrain invisible supernovae,
which have no optical emission but are powerful neutrino sources before being
swallowed by a forming black hole. Leveraging the differences in the spectra
between invisible and visible supernovae, we estimate the sensitivity of 1)
detecting the existence of invisible supernovae, and 2) determining the
fraction of invisible supernovae. Finally, we discuss how these conclusions
depend on the spectral parameters of the black hole-forming component.
