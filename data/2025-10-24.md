### [1] [A resistive MHD module in the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code GRaM-X](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18968)
*Sara Azizi,Swapnil Shankar,Philipp Mösta,Roland Haas,Erik Schnetter*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 本文提出了GPU加速的电阻性广义相对论磁流体动力学代码GRaM-X，能够模拟高能天体物理环境中的电阻效应，包括磁重联、耗散和磁层动力学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理想GRMHD假设无限电导率，忽略了电阻效应，而这些效应对于磁重联、耗散和磁层动力学等过程至关重要。天体物理环境中的等离子体并非完美导体，因此需要将电阻纳入模型。

Method: 使用Z4c形式演化爱因斯坦方程，实现二阶隐式-显式Runge-Kutta方案处理刚性源项，采用一维恢复方法从守恒量获取原始量，结合HLLE黎曼解算器与TVD和WENO重构方案。

Result: 通过一系列标准测试验证了模块的准确性，包括1D激波管、电流片、阿尔芬波、2D圆柱爆炸和3D TOV星，结果显示能够准确恢复理想MHD极限，正确模拟电阻行为，并在动态时空下保持稳定演化。

Conclusion: GPU加速的电阻性GRaM-X版本能够高效进行大规模模拟，为在多信使天体物理框架下研究双星合并、吸积流和相对论喷流等现实问题铺平了道路。

Abstract: Relativistic macroscopic plasma dynamics can be described by
general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. In many high-energy astrophysical
settings, such as the interior dynamics of magnetized stars, the ideal GRMHD
approximation, in which we assume infinite conductivity, provides an excellent
description. However, ideal GRMHD neglects resistive effects that are essential
for processes such as magnetic reconnection, dissipation, and magnetospheric
dynamics. Incorporating resistivity into astrophysical plasma models accounts
for the fact that plasmas in such environments are not perfect conductors. We
present a resistive version of the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code GRaM-X, which
evolves the full resistive GRMHD equations using the Z4c formalism for
Einstein's equations. We implement a second-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta
scheme to handle stiff source terms, obtain the primitive quantities from the
conserved quantities using a one-dimensional recovery method, and employ the
HLLE Riemann solver in combination with TVD and WENO reconstruction schemes. We
validate the module using a range of standard tests, including 1D shocktubes,
current sheets, Alfv\'{e}n waves, 2D cylindrical explosions, and 3D TOV stars.
The results of these tests demonstrate accurate recovery of the ideal MHD
limit, correct resistive behavior, and stable evolution in dynamical
spacetimes. Leveraging the GPU-accelerated resistive version of GRaM-X enables
efficient large-scale simulations, paving the way for realistic studies of
binary mergers, accretion flows, and relativistic jets within the framework of
multi-messenger astrophysics.

TL;DR: 使用VERITAS伽马射线观测数据研究轴子类粒子(ALPs)，通过分析NGC 1275星系2017年耀斑数据，未发现ALPs存在证据，在特定质量范围内设定了置信度限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轴子类粒子是标准模型扩展理论中的假设粒子，其与电磁场的耦合会在外部磁场中与光子混合，可能在TeV伽马射线源光谱中留下印记。

Method: 使用gammapy分析包分析VERITAS数据，进行广泛拟合和建模，采用CLs方法进行似然分析以搜索ALPs证据并设置置信限制。

Result: 未发现ALPs存在证据，在质量范围2×10⁻⁷eV至4×10⁻⁷eV和耦合强度gₐγ≥3×10⁻¹¹ GeV⁻¹处获得最强排除限制，置信度最高达80%。

Conclusion: CLs方法被证明是可靠的方法，建议在灵敏度有限的搜索机制中采用这种保守的限制设置方法。

Abstract: Background: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical particles that
emerge in numerous theoretical extensions to the Standard Model. Their coupling
to electromagnetic field implies that ALPs would mix with photons in the
presence of external magnetic fields. As ALP phenomenology is governed by the
mass and strength of its coupling, there is a subset of this parameter space in
which this mixing would be expected to leave an imprint on the spectra of TeV
gamma-ray sources.
  Data: In 2017, the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory recorded the second day of a
dramatic flare of the radio galaxy NGC 1275, embedded at the center of the
Perseus galaxy cluster. This serendipitous locale provides a spatially-extended
magnetic field of strength O(10$\mu$G) through which escaping photons traverse,
making it an excellent target to study ALPs.
  Methods: We analyze the VERITAS data of NGC 1275's 2017 flare with the
gammapy analysis package. Extensive fitting and modeling are performed to
ultimately conduct a likelihood analysis used to search for any evidence of a
preference for ALPs and to explore the confidence with which constraints can be
set. We adopt the CLs method for this study for its conservative approach to
setting limits in regimes where the search has limited sensitivity.
  Results: No evidence for the existence of ALPs is found, and no combination
of mass and coupling strength can be excluded at or above 95% confidence level.
We provide a map showing the strength of our exclusions in the mass and
coupling parameter space. The strongest exclusions are found in the mass range
$2 \times 10^{-7}$eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-7}$eV and at the
coupling strength of $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3 \times 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ up to
80% confidence level, which are consistent with previous studies.
  Conclusions: We find the CLs method to be a trustworthy approach, and
advocate for its...

### [3] [X-ray Observations of Nova Scorpii 2023 (V1716 Sco) in Outburst](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19102)
*John Worley,Marina Orio,Andrej Dobrotka,Jozef Magdolen,Kim Page,Ehud Behar,Jeremy Drake,Sharon Mitrani*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Nova Scorpii 2023是一颗超软X射线源，在爆发后93天被首次探测到，持续发射软X射线超过两个月。观测显示其光度快速衰减，有效温度和持续时间表明存在一个质量约为1.2太阳质量的白矮星，并观测到77.9秒的周期性调制，可能与白矮星自转相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Nova Scorpii 2023的超软X射线源特性，了解其演化过程、白矮星质量以及观测到的周期性调制现象的物理机制。

Method: 使用Swift XRT、NICER和Chandra HRC/LETG进行多波段X射线观测，包括时序研究和光谱分析，通过拟合新星演化轨迹来确定白矮星参数。

Result: 观测到SSS通量不规则变化，在15-35埃范围内通量增加了近三倍；确定了9个月的恒定光度阶段；从光谱分析得出白矮星质量约为1.2太阳质量；检测到稳定的77.9秒周期性调制。

Conclusion: Nova Scorpii 2023的超软X射线源特性表明其包含一个大质量白矮星，观测到的77.9秒周期性调制很可能与白矮星的自转有关，为理解新星演化和白矮星物理提供了重要线索。

Abstract: Nova Scorpii 2023 was first detected as a luminous supersoft X-ray source
(SSS) 93 days after outburst and continued emitting soft X-rays for over two
months, until it was too close to the Sun to observe. The nova was monitored
with the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) and the Neutron Star Interior Composition
Explorer (NICER) on the International Space Station, and in long exposures with
the Chandra High Resolution Camera (HRC) and Low Energy Transmission Grating
(LETG) on days 128, 129, and 183-185 after optical maximum. Swift detected a
rapidly decaying SSS when observations resumed, constraining the constant
bolometric luminosity phase to 9 months. The SSS flux was irregularly variable.
A nearly three-fold increase in flux was observed between August and October
2023 in the 15 to 35 Angstrom range, from 3.5 x 10^(-11) to 9.4 x 10^(-11) erg
cm^(-2) s^(-1). The SSS duration and effective temperature derived from the
October LETG spectra indicate a massive white dwarf with temperature fitting
nova evolutionary tracks for a 1.2 solar mass WD; emission lines superimposed
on the WD continuum are attributed to surrounding shocked ejecta. We present a
timing study based on Chandra and archival NICER data. The irregular
variability timescale was days, but a 77.9 second periodic modulation in the
SSS flux with varying amplitude was measured in many observations. Our analysis
shows that this period was stable; short drifts derived with NICER, but not in
long, uninterrupted Chandra exposures, are artifacts of measuring variable
amplitude modulation. We suggest the modulations are associated with the WD
rotation.

TL;DR: 对短时伽马射线暴GRB 250221A的多波段观测分析，发现其具有紧凑双星合并特征但位于高密度环境，挑战了传统的持续时间分类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究短时伽马暴GRB 250221A的物理特性，特别是其爆发特性和余辉行为之间的矛盾，以探索伽马暴分类方法的局限性。

Method: 使用COLIBRÍ、Harlingten 50cm望远镜、甚大望远镜的光学和光谱观测，结合Swift、Einstein Probe的X射线数据以及甚大阵列的射电观测，进行多波段光变曲线分析和光谱红移测定。

Result: 测得红移z=0.768，宿主星系恒星形成率约3M⊙/年；X射线和光学余辉显示在T0+0.6天存在能量注入现象；爆发特性支持紧凑双星合并起源，但高密度环境(n~80 cm⁻³)更符合坍缩星环境特征。

Conclusion: GRB 250221A是一个不寻常的事件，其爆发特性与余辉环境之间的矛盾凸显了基于持续时间的分类方法的局限性，强调了多波段、时间分辨后续观测的重要性。

Abstract: We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the short-duration
GRB 250221A ($T_{90}=1.80\pm0.32$ s), using a data set from the optical
facilities COLIBR\'I, the Harlingten 50 cm Telescope, and the Very Large
Telescope. We complement these observations with data from the \textit{Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory} and the \textit{Einstein Probe}, as well as radio
observations from the Very Large Array. GRB 250221A is among the few short GRBs
with direct afterglow spectroscopy, which gives a secure redshift determination
of $z=0.768$ and allows the unambiguous identification of the host as a galaxy
with a star-formation rate of $\sim3\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The X-ray and
optical light curves up to $T_0+10$ ks (where $T_0$ refers to the GRB trigger
time) are well described by forward-shock synchrotron emission in the
slow-cooling regime within the standard fireball framework. However, at
$T_0+0.6$ days, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the
same interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet
with a half-opening angle of $\theta_j=11.5^{\circ}$ through a refreshed shock
powered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The
burst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the
Amati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling
of the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$),
which is more typical of a Collapsar environment. This tension over the
classification of this burst (short-hard vs. long-soft) as inferred from the
prompt and afterglow emissions makes GRB~250221A an unusual event and
underscores the limitations of duration-based classifications and the
importance of multi-wavelength, time-resolved follow-up observations.

### [5] [Fast Radio Bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19143)
*J. I. Katz*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 快射电暴(FRB)发现18年后，其天文来源和辐射机制仍是个谜。它们具有与脉冲星相当的亮度，亮度温度高达约10^36K，表明是相干辐射，但形成相干电荷束的等离子体物理机制尚不清楚。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管快射电暴已被发现18年，但其物理起源、辐射机制和重复行为等基本问题仍未解决，需要深入理解这些高能天体现象。

Method: 通过观测分析不同FRB的特性，包括距离测量（从3.6Mpc到红移零点几的星系）、重复行为观察（有些重复数千次，大多数未观察到重复）、环境特征（密集等离子体环境vs高真空环境）。

Result: 发现FRB具有极高的亮度温度（~10^36K），表明相干辐射；来源多样，包括M81星系球状星团、红移零点几的星系；部分FRB重复发生，部分未观察到重复；环境条件差异很大。

Conclusion: FRB的物理机制仍然神秘，可能的来源包括磁星和黑洞吸积盘，但形成相干电荷束的等离子体物理过程尚未被理解，重复行为的本质也不明确。

Abstract: Eighteen years after their discovery, the astronomical sources and radiation
mechanisms of fast radio bursts remain mysterious. Their radiation is as bright
as that of pulsars, with brightness temperatures as high as $\sim 10^{36}$ K,
implying coherent emission, but the plasma physics that forms the coherent
charge bunches, with net charges of order a Coulomb, is not understood. Some
FRB have been identified with galaxies at redshifts of a few tenths, but one
originated within a globular cluster in the galaxy M81 at a distance of 3.6
Mpc. A minority of FRB have been observed to repeat, in some cases thousands of
times. The vast majority of FRB have not been observed to repeat, but it is not
known if they are truly ``one-offs'' or repeat at unobservably long intervals.
Some FRB originate within dense, rapidly varying, plasma environments, while
others appear to be surrounded by high vacuum. Hypotheses for their sources
include magnetars and black hole accretion discs.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 通过对4U 1624-490中子星低质量X射线双星系统的XMM EPIC pn观测，发现吸积盘冲击区域的隆起物是一个多相、团块状的吸收介质，包含电离和较冷的吸收体，估计团块数量超过7×10³个。

Method: 使用四个XMM EPIC pn观测数据，采用时间和通量分辨光谱分析来探测隆起物的结构特性和均匀性。

Result: 发现隆起物是一个多相、团块状的吸收介质，包含电离度logξ∼3.4的吸收体和较冷吸收体，团块数量估计>7×10³个。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了构建隆起物物理图像的可行性，未来研究可揭示其性质如何依赖系统参数，以及隆起物是否影响吸积盘动力学。

Abstract: Dipping neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (NS LMXBs) are systems that
exhibit periodic drops in their X-ray light curves. These are believed to be
caused by material at the impact point of the gas stream onto the accretion
disk, the bulge. Dipping systems are observed at high inclination and provide
exceptional opportunities to address important open questions about accretion
disks, such as the physical properties of the bulge, and the connection between
disk atmospheres and disk winds. We aimed to characterize the accretion disk
plasmas present in the 21h-period NS LMXB 4U 1624-490, and perform a detailed
spectral analysis of the material present at the impact region. We used four
XMM EPIC pn observations that were specifically targeting dips, and allow us to
probe dipping activity over different timescales (i.e. consecutive orbits and
$\sim$6 months). We use both time- and flux-resolved spectroscopic analysis to
probe the structural properties of the bulge moving along the line of sight and
its homogeneity, respectively. During dipping, the primary spectrum is
modulated by an ionized (log$\xi\sim$ 3.4) absorber with varying column density
and covering factor, as well as a colder absorber. This suggests that the bulge
is a multiphase and clumpy absorbing medium. From size scale arguments, we
estimate the number of clumps in the bulge to be $>$7$\times10^{3}$. A highly
ionized disk atmosphere becomes evident only when different phases of
absorption are analyzed individually. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
constructing a physical picture of the bulge, and highlights how future
research could reveal how its properties depend on system parameters, and
whether the bulge could influence the dynamics of the accretion disk.

### [7] [Anomalous scattering of pulsars towards the Gum Nebula](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19388)
*M. A. Krishnakumar,Bhal Chandra Joshi,P. K. Manoharan*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 使用升级版GMRT的Band-3观测了14颗朝向Gum星云区域的脉冲星，获得了宽频散射展宽估计。研究发现Gum星云对远距离脉冲星的色散量和散射强度影响不大，并发现船帆脉冲星的散射主要由其超新星遗迹而非Gum星云引起。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增加对Gum星云区域脉冲星散射展宽频率标度指数的测量数量，研究Gum星云对脉冲星散射特性的影响。

Method: 使用升级版GMRT的Band-3进行宽频观测，分析14颗朝向Gum星云区域的脉冲星的散射展宽特性。

Result: 将Gum星云区域的散射展宽频率标度指数测量数量增加了3倍以上；发现距离与散射强度之间的强相关性；远距离脉冲星受Gum星云影响不大；船帆脉冲星的散射主要由其超新星遗迹引起。

Conclusion: Gum星云对近距离脉冲星的散射有显著影响，但对远距离脉冲星影响有限；船帆脉冲星的散射特性主要受其自身超新星遗迹支配。

Abstract: We report wideband scatter-broadening estimates of 14 pulsars towards the Gum
nebula region using the Band-3 of the upgraded GMRT. This work increases the
measurements of frequency scaling index of scatter-broadening ($\alpha$) across
the nebula by more than 3 times. A strong correlation between the distance and
the scattering strength is observed for pulsars behind the nebula. It is also
observed that for distant pulsars ($> 2 kpc$), the effect of the Gum nebula in
DM and scattering strength is not substantial. We also report a much flatter
$\alpha$ for the Vela pulsar and argue that its scattering is not caused by the
Gum nebula, but the Vela supernova remnant.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了使用图论和降维技术分析脉冲星种群的新方法，克服了传统可视化方法的维度限制，揭示了脉冲星之间超越标准自旋参数的相似性关系。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脉冲星分析方法存在维度限制，无法充分揭示脉冲星之间的复杂关系。作者希望通过数学方法，特别是图论和降维技术，提供新的分析视角。

Method: 采用图论、降维技术和创新的时间序列对齐方法，在无监督环境下进行二元分离和分类分析。

Conclusion: 这些数学方法为高能天体物理学提供了有前景的新方向，能够替代传统方法，为脉冲星种群可视化和源分类奠定新基础。

Abstract: In this thesis, we introduce novel methods for analyzing pulsar populations
using a variety of mathematical techniques. These tools-particularly graph
theory-have been thoroughly validated in advanced mathematics, enabling us to
overcome some of the constraints (even dimensional) inherent in conventional
visualization approaches. This exploration benefits from dimensionality
reduction techniques, which not only lessen computational demands but also
highlight potential for describing physical characteristics. The resulting
structures encode information about pulsar similarities that extend beyond
standard spin parameters, revealing relationships that are not readily apparent
in traditional diagrams. With a physically motivated topological perspective,
we leverage the strengths of these methods and present results that span from
prospective source classification and the emergence of new classes to catalog
comparison, among other applications. This new approach enables fresh
interpretations of longstanding problems, laying a new foundation for
visualizing the pulsar population and categorizing sources. Building on this,
we identify several sources as likely members of specific binary subclasses and
investigate the potential transitional nature of others. Furthermore, we extend
the use of graph theory to the boundary of machine learning, demonstrating its
capability for binary separation in an unsupervised context. Finally, we
introduce and apply an innovative, flexible time-series alignment technique to
the field of gamma-ray astrophysics. The method identifies notable similarities
among the light curves of gamma-ray pulsars. The results presented here are
promising, offering a refreshing direction for the field and new pathways for
rigorous mathematical analysis, ultimately providing meaningful alternatives to
traditional approaches in high-energy astrophysics.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了快速旋转黑洞在超辐射影响下的长期自旋演化，重点关注质量吸积率突然增加如何影响临界自旋下降阶段。研究发现，在超辐射下降前发生的吸积增强能显著改变黑洞自旋演化轨迹，而下降后的增强仅产生暂时性影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究黑洞在超辐射和可变吸积共同作用下的自旋演化，理解吸积增强如何影响超辐射排除区域，这对理解黑洞种群分布和演化具有重要意义。

Method: 使用数值模拟跟踪突然吸积增强对黑洞自旋演化的影响，分析吸积角动量增加与轴子云角动量移除之间的竞争过程。

Result: 超辐射下降前5倍爱丁顿吸积率持续4百万年，可使超辐射排除区域减少40%；轻轴子云黑洞对早期吸积增强更敏感，能产生持续数亿年的可观测自旋变化。

Conclusion: 吸积增强的时机对黑洞自旋演化至关重要，早期增强能显著重塑超辐射排除区域，而后期增强影响有限；轴子云质量决定了黑洞对可变吸积的敏感度。

Abstract: This paper explores how time-varying increases in mass accretion onto rapidly
spinning black holes influence their long-term spin evolution when affected by
superradiance - a process where energy is extracted from the black hole by a
surrounding axion field. Using simulations the study tracks how sudden
accretion boosts affect a critical spin-down phase (the superradiance drop)
during which the black hole's spin rapidly decreases while its mass remains
nearly constant. The black hole spin evolution is controlled by the competition
between two processes: how fast angular momentum is added through accretion,
and how fast it is removed by the axion cloud. One major conclusion is that
boosts to the accretion rate before the superradiance drop have the strongest
effect, as they can delay or reshape the drop and significantly shrink the
region of the mass-spin plane depopulated due to the superradiance. In
particular, a super-Eddington accretion rate of 5 times Eddington accretion,
lasting for 4 Myr and occurring 30 Myr before the superradiance drop can reduce
the superradiance exclusion region in the mass-spin plane by 40 percent. In
contrast, boosts to the accretion rate after the superradiance drop only cause
temporary changes in the black hole spin. The study also shows that black holes
with lighter axion clouds are more sensitive to these early boosts and can show
observable spin changes lasting tens to hundreds of millions of years. Heavier
axion clouds, however, require much stronger or longer-lasting boosts to
produce similar effects, making them more stable under variable accretion.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: 研究超新星激波与复杂CSM密度剖面相互作用，发现与CSM壳层相互作用可显著增强伽马射线辐射，峰值光度比平滑星风模型高数个量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型假设激波在平滑星风中膨胀，但许多超新星观测不支持这一假设。需要研究激波与复杂CSM密度剖面的相互作用。

Method: 使用PION代码模拟LBV周围的CSM和RSG周围的光电离约束壳层，使用RATPaC代码研究宇宙线加速和全电磁波谱辐射。

Result: 与CSM壳层相互作用可显著提升伽马射线辐射，峰值出现在爆炸后数周至数年。IIP型和IIn型遗迹的峰值光度比平滑星风预期高数个量级。

Conclusion: 高频率光学巡天和邻近超新星的连续射电监测是识别伽马射线后续观测目标的最佳策略，伽马射线可从几Mpc到几十Mpc的距离探测到。

Abstract: Early interaction of supernova blast waves with CSM has the potential to
accelerate particles to PeV energies, although this has not yet been detected.
Current models for this interaction assume the shock expands into a smooth
stellar wind, although observations of many SNe do not support this assumption.
  We extend previous work by considering shocks expanding into complex density
profiles consisting of smooth winds with dense CSM shells at various distances
from the progenitor star. We aim to predict the gamma-ray and multiwavelength
signatures of CSM interaction.
  We used the PION code to model the CSM around LBV including a brief episode
of enhanced mass-loss and to simulate the formation of photoionization-confined
shells around RSGs. Consequently, we used the time-dependent acceleration-code
RATPaC to study the acceleration of cosmic rays in SNe expanding into these
media and to evaluate the emitted radiation across the whole electromagnetic
spectrum.
  We find that the interaction with the CSM shells can significantly boost the
gamma-ray emission, with the emission peaking weeks to years after the
explosion. The peak luminosity for Type-IIP and Type-IIn remnants can exceed
the luminosity expected for smooth winds by orders of magnitude. For Type-IIP
explosions, the light-curve peak is only reached years after the explosion. We
evaluate the multiwavelength signatures expected from the interaction of the
blast wave with a dense CSM shell from radio, over optical, to thermal X-rays.
  We identify high-cadence optical surveys and continuous monitoring of nearby
SN in radio and mm wavelengths as the best-suited strategies for identifying
targets that should be followed-up by gamma-ray observatories. We predict that
gamma-rays from interaction with dense CSM shells may be detectable out to a
few Mpc for late interaction, and tens of Mpc for early interaction.

Abstract: In the vicinity of neutron star mergers (NSMs), it is possible for the
neutrino self-interaction potential to cancel with the matter potential leading
to matter neutrino resonance (MNR). MNR is one of the most interesting
mechanisms by which neutrino flavor evolution can occur in dense astrophysical
environments. Previous studies have typically assumed that the neutrino flavor
field evolves to a steady state -- a simplification also used in other
self-interaction models such as the neutrino-bulb model. Here, we perform
reproducible calculations of MNR using both time-independent and time-dependent
formalisms and show that they yield qualitatively different flavor survival
probabilities. The time-independent approach produces unstable steady-state
solutions that differ fundamentally from the dynamical behavior captured in
time-dependent simulations. These results demonstrate that the steady-state
assumption is generally invalid, and physical interpretations based on
time-independent calculations of dense neutrino systems require re-evaluation.

Abstract: Powerful ionized accretion disk winds are often observed during episodic
outbursts in Galactic black hole transients. Among those X-ray absorbers,
\fexxvi\ doublet structure (Ly$\alpha_1$+Ly$\alpha_2$ with $\sim 20$eV apart)
has a unique potential to better probe the underlying physical nature of the
wind; i.e. density and kinematics. We demonstrate, based on a
physically-motivated magnetic disk wind scenario of a stratified structure in
density and velocity, that the doublet line profile can be effectively utilized
as a diagnostics to measure wind density and associated velocity dispersion
(due to thermal turbulence and/or dynamical shear motion in winds). Our
simulated doublet spectra with post-process radiative transfer calculations
indicate that the profile can be (1) broad with a single peak for higher
velocity dispersion ($\gsim 5,000$ km~s$^{-1}$), (2) a standard shape with 1:2
canonical flux ratio for moderate dispersion ($\sim 1,000-5,000$ km~s$^{-1}$)
or (3) double-peaked with its flux ratio approaching 1:1 for lower velocity
dispersion ($\lsim 1,000$ km~s$^{-1}$) in optically-thin regime, allowing
various line shape. Such a diversity in doublet profile is indeed unambiguously
seen in recent observations with XRISM/Resolve at microcalorimeter resolution.
We show that some implications inferred from the model will help constrain the
local wind physics where \fexxvi\ is predominantly produced in a large-scale,
stratified wind.

Motivation: 研究$^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge和$^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As热核反应如何调节ZnGa和GeAs循环，以及这些反应速率变化对I型X射线暴模型与观测特性匹配的影响。

Abstract: The $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As
thermonuclear reactions connect the ZnGa and GeAs cycles by diverting the flow
of the rapid proton capture process from $^{63}$Ga to $^{65}$As. Changes in
these two reaction rates regulate the ZnGa and GeAs cycles and may affect the
modeled properties matching with the observed counterparts of a type I X-ray
burster. We implement the latest $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and
$^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As reaction rates to the state-of-the-art
self-consistent one-dimensional multi-zone thermo-hydrodynamic code, KEPLER, to
study the influence of these new reaction rates on the models of the GS
1826$-$24 clocked burster and SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion
burster. Both new reaction rates obtained by Lu et al. [Phys. Rev. C 110,
065804 (2024)] are determined from complementing the experimental input with
the nuclear spectroscopic information deduced from the full pf-shell space
configuration-interaction shell-model calculations. By constraining the models
on reproducing the observed burst peak, light-curve profile, fluence, and
recurrence time, we find that the impact of the newly measured proton
thresholds and respective proton-capture reactions on the burst light-curve
profile of the GS 1826$-$24 clocked burster is, in fact, not as significant as
claimed by Zhou et al. [Nat. Phys. 19, 1091 (2023)]. With or without the
inclusion of the newly determined reaction rate of the highly influential
$^{22}$Mg($\alpha$,p)$^{25}$Al reaction, the impact of the new
$^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As reaction
rates on SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion bursts is evident.
Our finding indicates that the models reproducing the 2002 October epoch of SAX
J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion burster is more sensitive to the
uncertainties of thermonuclear reaction rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为黑洞X射线双星的吸积由洛希瓣溢出或星风供应，分别形成几何薄盘或厚热吸积流。本文考虑更一般情况，即同时包含冷热气体供应，分别供给盘和冕。

Method: 采用半解析方法分析盘与冕之间的能量耦合和物质交换（冕凝结/盘蒸发过程）。

Result: 发现吸积几何结构和发射光谱取决于总气体供应率和冷热气体比例。在中等吸积率下，不同冷气体比例可产生多样的几何结构和光谱形状；高吸积率下内区总是盘主导；低吸积率下热流主导产生硬态光谱。通过比较MAXI观测数据，约束了吸积流粘滞参数为0.25-0.35。

Conclusion: 冷热气体混合供应的吸积模型能够解释中间态观测到的各种光谱，并预测了天鹅座X-1的硬度-强度相关性，为理解黑洞双星吸积过程提供了更全面的框架。

Abstract: Accretion in black hole X-ray binaries is commonly believed to be supplied by
the Roche lobe overflow or the stellar wind. The former is thought to form a
geometrically thin disc while the diffuse wind could form a geometrically thick
hot accretion flow. In this paper, we instead consider a more generalised case,
i.e., accretion with both cold and hot gas supplies, which feed a disc and a
corona respectively. We investigate the interaction of disc and corona by
analysing the energy coupling and matter exchange, i.e. corona
condensation/disc evaporation, with a semi-analytical method. It is found that
the accretion geometry in the radial direction and the resultant emission
spectrum depend strongly on both the total gas supply rate and the ratio of
cold and hot gases. For gas supply rates of a few percent of the Eddington
value, diverse geometries and spectral shapes are possible, depending on the
fraction of cold gas supply. This provides an interpretation for the various
spectra observed in intermediate states. However, at higher accretion rates,
regardless of the form of the feeding gas, the inner accretion flow is always
disc-dominated, implying an inevitable transition to the soft state, while at
very low gas supply rates, hard state spectrum dominated by the hot flow is
expected. We also present the predicted hardness-intensity correlation of
Cygnus X-1, and constrain the value of the viscosity parameter of the accretion
flow to the range of 0.25--0.35 by comparing our results with MAXI
observations.

TL;DR: 论文发现地面无线电LDF电场振幅与大气中X_max位置存在强相关性，这为宇宙射线成分分析提供了新方法。X_max依赖性可通过两种竞争性缩放机制解释：密度缩放(1/ρ)^J和距离缩放1/R，两者共同影响无线电发射的相干性。

Motivation: 探索宇宙射线成分与无线电信号振幅之间的关系，揭示X_max位置对地面无线电测量的影响，为宇宙射线成分的直接推断提供新途径。

Method: 分析无线电LDF电场振幅与X_max位置的依赖关系，建立包含密度缩放(1/ρ)^J和距离缩放1/R的理论模型，考虑不同天顶角下相干性损失的影响。

Result: 发现X_max位置显著影响地面无线电电场振幅，这种依赖性可用于直接推断宇宙射线初级成分，甚至无需重建X_max。低天顶角时1/R缩放占主导，高天顶角时相干性损失影响更复杂。

Conclusion: 无线电LDF振幅对X_max/成分的强依赖性为宇宙射线成分分析提供了新工具，可能影响其他无线电重建方法，并可能导致X_max/成分在能量重建中的偏差。

Abstract: We show that there is a strong dependence of the radio LDF electric field
amplitudes at ground level on the position of $X_{\rm max}$ in the atmosphere,
even accounting for differences in the EM energy of the showers. Since an
$X_{\rm max}$ dependence leads to a primary composition dependence, this
implies that information on the mass composition is encoded not only in the LDF
shape but also in its amplitude. This $X_{\rm max}$ dependence can be explained
in terms of two competing scalings of the measured electric field: One goes
with $(1/\rho)^J$, where $\rho$ is the air density at $X_{\rm max}$ and $J$ is
a zenith dependent non-linearity factor describing coherence loss. This density
scaling tends to decrease the geomagnetic emission of deeper showers. The other
scaling goes with $(1/R)$, where $R$ is the distance from $X_{\rm max}$ to the
core at ground, and instead increases the measured electric field of deeper
showers. At low zenith angles, the $(1/R)$ scaling is stronger and leads to
larger measured electric fields as $X_{\rm max}$ increases. The picture at
higher zeniths, i.e., lower densities, is more nuanced. In this region, the
deflections due to the Lorentz force are much larger and introduce extra time
delays between the particle tracks, decreasing the coherence of the emission.
This loss of coherence is highly dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic
field and can slow down, or even reverse the increase of the radio emission
with decreasing air density. This strong, yet historically overlooked LDF
amplitude dependence on $X_{\rm max}$/composition could be used to directly
infer, even bypassing any $X_{\rm max}$ reconstruction, the cosmic ray primary
composition on an event-by-event basis. It could also have some repercussions
on other radio reconstruction methods, such as a possible $X_{\rm
max}$/composition bias on shower electromagnetic energy reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: 观测数据缺口会显著影响时间序列分析的可靠性，SSA是处理不完整数据的最有效方法，检测到的≥3σ置信度周期不太可能来自随机过程或数据缺口。

Abstract: Time series analysis is fundamental to characterizing the variability
inherent in multi-wavelength emissions from blazars. However, a major
observational challenge lies in the need for well-sampled, temporally uniform
data, which is often hindered by irregular sampling and data gaps. These gaps
can significantly affect the reliability and accuracy of methods used to probe
source variability. This paper investigates the impact of such observational
gaps on time series analysis of blazar emissions. To do so, we systematically
evaluate how these gaps alter observed variability patterns, mask genuine
periodic signals, and introduce false periodicity detections. This evaluation
is conducted using both simulated and real observational data. We assess a
range of widely used time series analysis methods, including the Lomb-Scargle
periodogram, Phase Dispersion Minimization, and the recently proposed Singular
Spectrum Analysis (SSA). Our results demonstrate a clear and significant
degradation in period detection reliability when the percentage of gaps exceeds
50\%. In such cases, the period-significance relationship becomes increasingly
distorted, often leading to misleading results. Among the tested methods, SSA
stands out for its ability to yield consistent and robust detections despite
high data incompleteness. Additionally, the analyzed methods tend to identify
artificial periodicities of around one year, likely due to seasonal sampling
effects, which can result in false positives if not carefully recognized.
Finally, the periods detected with $\geq$3$\sigma$ confidence are unlikely to
result from stochastic processes or from the presence of gaps in the analyzed
time series.

Conclusion: NGC 7469和NGC 1068中微子能谱的差异可能源于磁化参数的不同，尽管它们属于同一类活动星系核，这为理解高能中微子起源提供了新视角。

Abstract: The origin of TeV-PeV neutrinos detected by IceCube remains largely unknown.
The most significant individual neutrino source is the close-by Seyfert galaxy
NGC 1068 at 4.2$\sigma$ level with a soft spectral index. Another notable
candidate is the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469, which has been recently proposed as a
potential neutrino emitter. The likelihood fit of the IceCube data for this
source returned a very hard spectral index of ~ 1.9 and the excess is dominated
by two high-energy events, issued as two neutrino alerts IC220424A and
IC230416A. The energies of the two neutrinos are estimated to be 100-200 TeV,
implying a maximum proton energy > 2 PeV, significantly higher than that in NGC
1068. The lack of lower-energy neutrinos from NGC 7469 also suggests a neutrino
spectrum harder than that of NGC 1068. In this paper, we analyze the Fermi-LAT
observations of NGC 7469, which yield non-detection. By requiring the cascade
flux accompanying neutrino production not to exceed the upper limit of the GeV
flux, the size of the neutrino-emitting region can be constrained when the
neutrino flux takes a high value of the allowed range. We suggest that protons
are accelerated to PeV energies via turbulence or magnetic reconnection in the
corona of NGC 7469 and interact with OUV photons from the accretion disk and
X-rays from the corona through the $p\gamma$ process, producing neutrinos with
energy of 100-200 TeV. In the turbulence acceleration scenario, the required
maximum proton energy can be achieved with a magnetization parameter close to
unity ($\sigma\sim 1$), while in the reconnection scenario, a magnetization
parameter with $\sigma\sim 10$ is needed. In both scenarios, a pair dominated
composition for the corona is preferred. The difference in the neutrino
spectrum between NGC 7469 and NGC 1068 could be due to a different
magnetization despite that they belong to the same type of AGN.

Abstract: We present an analysis of neutrino-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and
instabilities in a rotating magnetoplasma with weak neutrino interactions. We
show, for the first time, that neutrino-driven shear Alfv{\'e}n and oblique
magnetosonic waves can be coupled by the Coriolis force, forming new wave modes
affected by this force, as well as neutrino beam and two neutrino flavor
oscillations. Our work extends previous theories by demonstrating that shear
Alfv{\'e}n waves are influenced by neutrino effects and by identifying
instabilities resulting from resonant interactions with both a streaming
neutrino beam and flavor oscillations. We find that the Coriolis force, as well
as plasma density and magnetic field strength, have a significant impact on the
profiles of the instability growth rates. Our findings may shed new light on
the physical mechanisms underlying core-collapse supernovae.
